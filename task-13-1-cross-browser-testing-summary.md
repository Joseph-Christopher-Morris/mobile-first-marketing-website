- Focus indicators: ✅ Visible

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### Minor Issues Found

1. **Playwright Test Selectors**: Some test selectors needed adjustment for blog
   preview elements
2. **Performance Budget**: One image exceeded 3-second load time threshold
3. **Mobile Device Configuration**: Device definitions needed refinement

### Resolutions Applied

1. Updated test selectors to match current DOM structure
2. Identified performance optimization opportunities
3. Fixed mobile device configuration in test suite

## Recommendations Implemented

### Immediate Actions Completed
