# 🚀 GitHub Upload - Let's Do This Now!

## Step 1: Create Repository (2 minutes)

1. **Open GitHub**: Go to https://github.com
2. **Sign in** to your account
3. **Click the green "New" button** (top left) or the "+" icon → "New repository"
4. **Fill out the form:**
   - Repository name: `vivid-auto-photography-website`
   - Description: `Professional automotive photography website - All fixes complete`
   - Make it **Public** (recommended for deployment)
   - ✅ Check "Add a README file"
   - Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Upload Files (10 minutes)

### 2a. Upload Source Code (MOST CRITICAL)
1. **Click "uploading an existing file"** (blue link in the middle)
2. **Open File Explorer** to: `C:\Users\Joe\Projects\website-sync-20251003_133144`
3. **Drag the entire `src` folder** into the GitHub upload area
4. **Wait for upload** - this contains all your React components and pages
5. **Don't commit yet** - we'll add more files first

### 2b. Upload Images and Assets
1. **Click "choose your files"** or drag more files
2. **Drag the `public` folder** - this contains all your images
3. **Wait for upload** - this is why your images work!

### 2c. Upload Configuration Files
**Drag these individual files:**
- `package.json` (your dependencies)
- `next.config.js` (build configuration)
- `tailwind.config.js` (styling)
- `tsconfig.json` (TypeScript config)
- `.eslintrc.json` (code quality)

### 2d. Upload Content and Scripts
**Drag these folders:**
- `content` folder (blog content)
- `scripts` folder (deployment scripts)
- `.github` folder (if it exists - for auto-deployment)

## Step 3: Commit Everything (1 minute)
