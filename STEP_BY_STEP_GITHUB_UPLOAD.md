### Path B: Install Git + Use Scripts (Recommended for Future)
**Best for:** Long-term development and automatic deployments

---

## 🎯 PATH A: Manual Upload (Quick & Easy)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. **Go to GitHub**: Open https://github.com in your browser
2. **Sign in** to your GitHub account (or create one if needed)
3. **Click "New"** (green button) or the "+" icon → "New repository"
4. **Repository Settings:**
   - Name: `vivid-auto-photography-website` (or your preferred name)
   - Description: `Professional automotive photography website`
   - Make it **Public** (so it can be deployed) or Private (your choice)
   - ✅ Check "Add a README file"
   - Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Upload Critical Files
**Upload in this exact order:**

#### 2a. Upload Source Code First
1. **Click "uploading an existing file"** or "Add file" → "Upload files"
2. **Drag and drop the `src` folder** from your project
   - This is the most critical folder - contains all your React components
   - Wait for it to upload completely

#### 2b. Upload Images and Assets
1. **Add more files** → Upload the `public` folder
   - Contains all your images and static assets
   - This is why your images work!

#### 2c. Upload Configuration
1. **Add these individual files:**
   - `package.json` (your updated dependencies)
   - `next.config.js` (your build configuration)
   - `tailwind.config.js` (styling configuration)
   - `tsconfig.json` (TypeScript configuration)

#### 2d. Upload Content and Scripts
1. **Upload these folders:**
   - `content` folder (your blog content)
   - `scripts` folder (deployment scripts)
   - `.github` folder (if it exists - for auto-deployment)

### Step 3: Commit Your Upload
**Commit message to use:**
```
🎉 Website Image & Navigation Fixes - Production Ready

✅ All issues resolved:
- Fixed desktop hamburger menu (mobile-only now)
- All images loading correctly across site
- Service cards displaying proper images
- Blog preview images working
- ESLint errors resolved
- Performance optimized

## 🛠️ PATH B: Install Git + Use Scripts

### Step 1: Install Git
1. **Download Git**: Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. **Run the installer** with default settings
3. **Restart your computer** (important!)
4. **Test installation**: Open PowerShell and type `git --version`

### Step 2: Use Our Script
1. **Double-click** the `save-to-github.bat` file in your project
2. **Follow the prompts** - it will:
   - Initialize Git repository
   - Add all your files
   - Create a commit with proper message
3. **Connect to GitHub** (follow the instructions it shows)

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After uploading, check your GitHub repository shows:
- [ ] `src` folder with all subfolders
- [ ] `public/images` folder with all images
- [ ] `package.json` file
- [ ] `next.config.js` file
- [ ] Repository shows your commit message
- [ ] File count should be 100+ files

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Upload Failed" or "File Too Large"
- **Solution**: Upload folders one at a time instead of all at once
- **Alternative**: Use Git method (Path B)

### "Repository Empty After Upload"
- **Check**: Make sure you uploaded the `src` folder
- **Fix**: The `src` folder is the most critical - without it, nothing works

### "Images Not Showing After Deploy"
- **Check**: Make sure `public` folder uploaded completely
- **Verify**: All image files should be visible in `public/images/`

## 🎉 After Upload Success

### Immediate Benefits:
- ✅ Your website is now backed up
- ✅ Version control for future changes
- ✅ Can share with team members
- ✅ Professional development workflow

### Next Steps:
1. **Test the repository** - clone it to another folder and run `npm install`
2. **Set up auto-deployment** (optional) - pushes automatically deploy
3. **Make future changes** with confidence - you have a backup!
