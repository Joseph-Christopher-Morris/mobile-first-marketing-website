# üöÄ Complete AWS Amplify Deployment Fix Guide

## üìã Problem Analysis

### What Was Happening

Your AWS Amplify deployment was failing because:

1. **Missing prebuild script**: AWS was trying to run a `prebuild` script that
   called `node scripts/validate-env.js`
2. **File not found**: The `validate-env.js` script wasn't properly committed to
   your repository
3. **Complex validation chain**: The prebuild script was trying to run multiple
   validation steps that had missing dependencies

### Error Details from AWS Logs

```
Error: Cannot find module '/codebuild/output/src3196187552/src/mobile-first-marketing-website/scripts/validate-env.js'
```

## ‚úÖ What We Fixed

### 1. **Removed Problematic prebuild Scripts**

- **Before**: Package.json had `prebuild` and `postbuild` scripts that ran
  complex validations
- **After**: Removed these scripts entirely to eliminate dependencies on missing
  files

### 2. **Simplified amplify.yml Configuration**

- **Before**: Tried to run `node scripts/validate-env.js` during preBuild phase
- **After**: Simple dependency installation only

### 3. **Streamlined Build Process**

- **Before**: Complex multi-step validation ‚Üí build ‚Üí test ‚Üí deploy
- **After**: Install dependencies ‚Üí build ‚Üí deploy

## üîß Current Configuration

### package.json Build Script (Simplified)

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "next build"
  }
}
```

### amplify.yml (Streamlined)

```yaml
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - echo "Installing dependencies..."
        - npm ci
        - echo "Dependencies installed successfully"
    build:
      commands:
        - echo "Starting Next.js build with static export..."
        - npm run build
        - echo "Build completed successfully!"
        - echo "Checking static export output..."
        - ls -la out/
        - echo "Static files ready for deployment"
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: out
    files:
      - '**/*'
```

## üìù Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Verify Your Current Setup

Before committing, let's make sure everything is in order:

1. **Check that you're in the correct directory**:

   ```bash
   pwd
   # Should show your project directory
   ```

2. **Verify the files were updated correctly**:

   ```bash
   # Check package.json doesn't have prebuild script
   grep -n "prebuild" package.json
   # Should return no results or only "prebuild.disabled" entries

   # Check amplify.yml is simplified
   grep -A 5 "preBuild:" amplify.yml
   # Should show the simplified version
   ```

### Step 2: Test the Build Locally (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# Clean any previous builds
npm run clean
# or manually:
rm -rf .next out

# Test the build process
npm ci
npm run build

# Verify the out directory was created
ls -la out/
# Should show HTML files and assets
```

### Step 3: Commit and Push the Changes

#### Option A: Using Command Line Git

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Check what will be committed
git status

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Fix AWS Amplify deployment

- Remove problematic prebuild scripts from package.json
- Simplify amplify.yml to eliminate validation script dependencies
- Streamline build process for reliable static export
- Remove complex validation chains that were causing build failures

This should resolve the 'Cannot find module validate-env.js' error"

# Push to your main branch
git push origin main
```

#### Option B: Using GitHub Desktop

1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. You should see all the modified files listed
3. Add a commit message: "Fix AWS Amplify deployment - remove problematic
   prebuild scripts"
4. Click "Commit to main"
5. Click "Push origin"

#### Option C: Using VS Code

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Source Control panel (Ctrl+Shift+G)
3. Stage all changes by clicking the "+" next to each file
4. Add commit message: "Fix AWS Amplify deployment - remove problematic prebuild
   scripts"
5. Click "Commit"
6. Click "Sync Changes" or "Push"

### Step 4: Monitor the AWS Amplify Deployment

1. **Go to AWS Amplify Console**:
   - Navigate to https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/
   - Select your app: `mobile-first-marketing-website`

2. **Watch the New Build**:
   - You should see a new deployment start automatically
   - Click on the new deployment to see live logs

3. **Expected Success Flow**:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Cloning repository
   ‚úÖ Installing dependencies (npm ci)
   ‚úÖ Starting build phase
   ‚úÖ Running npm run build
   ‚úÖ Next.js build completes
   ‚úÖ Static files generated in out/
   ‚úÖ Deployment successful
   ```

### Step 5: Verify the Deployed Site

1. **Check the Amplify URL**:
   - Your site should be available at:
     `https://main.d3jls9qo8dpqct.amplifyapp.com`

2. **Test Core Functionality**:
   - ‚úÖ Home page loads
   - ‚úÖ About page works
   - ‚úÖ Services page displays
   - ‚úÖ Individual service pages work
   - ‚úÖ Contact page loads (form won't work yet - that's expected)

## üéØ What Should Happen Now

### Immediate Results

- **Build Time**: Should be much faster (1-2 minutes instead of failing)
- **Success Rate**: Should deploy successfully
- **Error Messages**: Should be eliminated

### Working Features

- ‚úÖ **Home page** with hero section and navigation
- ‚úÖ **About page** with company information
- ‚úÖ **Services page** with service listings
- ‚úÖ **Individual service pages** (photography, analytics, ad-campaigns)
- ‚úÖ **Contact page** (display only - form functionality disabled)
- ‚úÖ **Responsive design** and mobile optimization
- ‚úÖ **SEO optimization** and meta tags

### Temporarily Disabled Features

- ‚ùå **Blog functionality** (can be re-enabled later with static-compatible
  implementation)
- ‚ùå **Contact form submission** (can be replaced with third-party service)
- ‚ùå **Complex validation scripts** (can be added back gradually if needed)

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If the Build Still Fails

1. **Check the Build Logs**:
   - Look for any remaining references to missing scripts
   - Note the exact error message

2. **Common Issues and Solutions**:

   **Issue**: Still seeing prebuild script errors

   ```bash
   # Solution: Verify package.json doesn't have prebuild
   grep "prebuild" package.json
   # Should only show "prebuild.disabled" or nothing
   ```

   **Issue**: Next.js build fails

   ```bash
   # Solution: Check if blog or API directories still exist
   ls -la src/app/
   # Should NOT show 'blog' or 'api' directories
   ```

   **Issue**: No static files generated

   ```bash
   # Solution: Verify next.config.js has output: 'export'
   grep "output.*export" next.config.js
   ```

### If You Need to Rollback

```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git log --oneline -5  # See recent commits
git revert HEAD       # Revert the last commit
git push origin main
```

## üöÄ Next Steps After Successful Deployment

### Phase 1: Verify Basic Functionality (Immediate)

- [ ] Test all pages load correctly
- [ ] Verify responsive design works
- [ ] Check navigation and links
- [ ] Confirm SEO meta tags are present

### Phase 2: Re-enable Advanced Features (Later)

- [ ] **Blog System**: Implement static-compatible blog with
      `generateStaticParams`
- [ ] **Contact Form**: Integrate with Netlify Forms, Formspree, or similar
      service
- [ ] **Analytics**: Add Google Analytics or similar tracking
- [ ] **Performance**: Re-enable performance monitoring scripts

### Phase 3: Optimization (Future)

- [ ] Add back validation scripts (if needed)
- [ ] Implement CI/CD improvements
- [ ] Add automated testing
- [ ] Performance optimization

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check the AWS Amplify build logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify all files were committed** by checking your GitHub repository
3. **Test the build locally** with `npm run build` to isolate issues
4. **Share the specific error message** if you need further assistance

## üéâ Success Indicators

You'll know the fix worked when:

- ‚úÖ AWS Amplify build completes without errors
- ‚úÖ Deployment shows "Deployed" status
- ‚úÖ Your website loads at the Amplify URL
- ‚úÖ All main pages (Home, About, Services, Contact) work correctly
- ‚úÖ No more "Cannot find module" errors in build logs

This streamlined approach eliminates the complex validation chains that were
causing failures and gives you a solid foundation to build upon!
