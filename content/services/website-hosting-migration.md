## Why Move to AWS Hosting

**Enterprise Performance at DIY Prices:** Wix Light costs £9 per month (£108 per year). My AWS hosting is similar in price but delivers enterprise-grade speed, better SEO, and personal support.  

**Instant Speed Boost:** Faster pages mean more visitors stay, more calls come in, and more sales happen.  

**Zero Downtime:** Your site stays live while we migrate everything behind the scenes.  

**No Tech Stress:** I manage the setup, security, and maintenance. You enjoy the results.

## Built for Local Businesses & Trades

Whether you run a café, garage, or trade service, your website should work as hard as you do.  

AWS hosting gives you:  

✅ A faster site that shows up higher on Google  
✅ Lower running costs  
✅ A trustworthy setup that never locks you in  
✅ More leads from people who actually find you online

Our Google ranking jumped almost immediately.  
Now I'm focusing on getting the same lift in Google results.
