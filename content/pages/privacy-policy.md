## What Personal Data We Collect and Why

At Vivid Auto Photography, we only collect the minimum personal information necessary. This occurs when you contact us, work with us, subscribe to our newsletter, or become a client. Information may include:

* Name
* Address
* Telephone number(s)
* Email address
* Signature
* Bank account details

We collect and process this data under legitimate interest, contractual obligation, or legal obligation to provide services you have requested. Your data will not be used for any other purpose without your explicit consent.

We do not collect unnecessary or excessive data, nor do we process **special category personal data**. We do not use **automated decision-making or profiling**. Data processing is always fair, lawful, and compliant with Articles 5 and 6 of GDPR.

We regularly conduct data flow audits and **Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)** to assess and mitigate privacy risks in our data processing (including storage, transmission, and access). We also complete **Legitimate Interest Assessments (LIAs)** to ensure that our marketing is appropriate and lawful.

We will never knowingly collect data from or about children under the age of 13.

* In the event of a sale of the company or its assets
* Trusted suppliers acting as data processors under robust contractual protections
* Legal authorities, where required by law

We do **not** require consent to share data when investigating suspected criminal or unlawful activity, but we will only contact relevant organisations.

We will never sell your data. If third-party sharing is ever required beyond the above, we will obtain your consent first.

## Data Breaches

We maintain procedures to detect, report, and investigate personal data breaches. If legally required, we will notify both you and the appropriate supervisory authority (ICO).

Your data is stored securely within the **United Kingdom**. We will not transfer your data outside of the **EU** without ensuring appropriate protection measures are in place.

## Retaining Your Data

We retain personal data only as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, including legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. Our **Data Retention Policy** considers data volume, sensitivity, potential risk, and legal requirements.

* For tax purposes, we must retain basic customer information (contact, identity, financial, and transaction data) for **six years** after you cease being a customer.
* If you have had no communication with us for six years, we will delete all personal data.

We may anonymise data for research or statistical use, in which case it may be retained indefinitely ‚Äî you will not be identifiable.

If you contact us via our website, we will assume you consent to us responding. We will not add your details to any mailing list without explicit consent. You can unsubscribe or opt out at any time by emailing **[joe@vividauto.photography](mailto:joe@vividauto.photography)**.
