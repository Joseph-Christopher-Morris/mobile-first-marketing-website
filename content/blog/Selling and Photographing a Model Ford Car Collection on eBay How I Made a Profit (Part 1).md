What started as a personal project to downsize my own Hot Wheels collection turned into something much bigger: photographing and selling my neighbour’s prized Ford model car collection on eBay.

This article is the first part of a five-part series where I’ll walk through how I photographed, listed, packaged, and shipped dozens of model cars — while refining my digital skills and navigating real customer expectations.

## Prologue: Starting Small, Thinking Big

In 2022 and 2023, I began slimming down my Hot Wheels car collection to earn a little extra income. At the same time, I wanted to learn the basics of e-commerce and customer service.

Through photographing each vehicle, editing images, and writing accurate and engaging descriptions, I aimed to create a great experience for every buyer. These early sales helped build a reputation for reliability.

Alongside this, I was freelancing as a photographer for classic car auctions. With strong market demand, I was able to sharpen my skills in both photography and vehicle presentation.

## A Seasonal Shift

As autumn arrived, auction shoots slowed down. The darker evenings and colder days pushed me back toward eBay, where I focused on selling as many Hot Wheels as possible before Christmas. Positive customer feedback helped me improve my workflow and listings, and I began to double down on strategies that worked.

## The Ford Opportunity

In June 2024, my neighbour approached me. A long-time Ford UK employee with a background in testing and stunt driving, he had a personal collection of Ford die-cast models. He offered me a commission to photograph and sell them on eBay.

We agreed on a **flat 25% commission** on the final sale price, excluding postage costs. This ensured fairness while covering the time I spent on photography, listings, packaging, and customer service.

This was a step up in terms of item value, condition expectations, and the need for a professional, scalable system.

## Photographing the First Model

The first car I shot was a **1:18 AUTOART Ford Focus WRC Rally car**. It barely fit in my portable studio, but it drew attention despite some cosmetic wear.

Using a **Sony A7III** with a **Nikon F-mount lens and converter**, I adapted my setup to get sharp close-up shots. Macro photography proved essential in capturing detail, especially for collector-grade models.

## Analytics and Optimisation

> 137,917 impressions in one week — 100% organic.  
> No ads. Just timing, SEO, and product knowledge.

These weren’t random models. Each represented my neighbour’s personal automotive journey. That gave me extra motivation to present the collection with care. I repurposed packaging materials and cardboard to safely ship each model while minimising waste.

In just one week (June 14–21, 2024), the model Ford listings earned over **137,000 impressions organically on eBay**, with a **1.1% CTR**.  
I tracked these metrics to refine timing and optimise titles for better visibility.

## Why This Model Ford Car Collection on eBay Mattered

I used **eBay’s Performance and Traffic pages** to monitor impressions, click-through rates, and sales. This helped me adjust titles, timing, and groupings to improve results without using promoted listings.
