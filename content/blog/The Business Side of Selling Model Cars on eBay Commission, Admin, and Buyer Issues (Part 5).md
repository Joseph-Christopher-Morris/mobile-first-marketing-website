In this final article, I reveal what it was like to run the project from the inside. Running an eBay model car selling business, especially when handling someone else’s collection, meant balancing **fairness**, **admin**, and **patience**.

## Prologue: Slow Sales, New Insights

By week five, most of the collection had sold. A few cars remained due to **niche appeal** or **unclear market value**. For models with limited data, I used my **instincts** to set prices.

## Commission and Payment Tracking in My eBay Model Car Selling Business

John and I agreed on a **75/25 split**. I managed everything:

- Photography  
- Customer service  
- Packaging  
- Listings  
- Postage  

An example from the **commission tracker** was shared with John. I used this spreadsheet to track every sale, deduct postage and fees, and ensure that payments were **fair and transparent**.

To maintain transparency, I used an **Excel spreadsheet** to track every sale. It listed the model, sale price, postage cost, and our respective shares. I printed this out and reviewed it with John directly.

**Payments** were sent after a **seven-day buffer** to account for any potential returns.

## Emotional and Practical Challenges

There was emotional weight to selling someone else’s collection. I wanted to do right by John. At the same time, I had to deal with:

- Buyers placing offers, then disappearing  
- Questions without follow‑up  
- Returns and refund requests  

I stayed calm and professional, cancelling unpaid orders after a grace period and **relisting** them during eBay's **promotional windows**.

## Conclusion

Selling John’s collection was a hands‑on, emotionally complex experience. It taught me how to **manage customer relationships**, **promote business transparency**, and **effectively present products** simultaneously.

John got funds for his home improvement project. I gained experience, income, and a story worth sharing.
