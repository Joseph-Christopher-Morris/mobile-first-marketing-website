## 🚀 Flyer V3: Built to Scale

By early 2023, I’d levelled up my content and my clients.

I had repeated work with Car & Classic, stronger visuals, and better grammar.
Time to scale.

**Flyer V3 Goals:**

- More varied, premium images
- Tighter writing
- A show-stopping cover

I chose each image to **create emotion, not just fill space.**

## ⚠️ NEC Show Roadbump

Right before the NEC Autosport International, Vistaprint emailed me:

> “Can’t print in time.”

I called, got it sorted, and got refunded.  
But by show day, only the old flyers were ready.

The NEC didn’t deliver many leads, but it was still worth attending. I met
passionate people and saw the best of motorsport tech — **still a win.**

## 📉 The Client Who Didn’t Pay… At First

Not every lead is golden.

Bidding Classics found me via LinkedIn. I delivered the work. Then came the
silence.

Like other photographers, I chased overdue invoices and eventually had to file a
CCJ.  
It worked — I got paid. But it reminded me that not every flashy brand respects
your time.

That experience sharpened my filters. Now I vet leads more thoroughly and focus
on clients who **value the craft.**
