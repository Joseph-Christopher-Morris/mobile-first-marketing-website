In this third part of the series, I’ll walk you through the tactics I used to improve the conversion rate when selling my neighbour’s model Ford collection. From timing listings to writing efficient descriptions and encouraging multi-item purchases, this phase of the project brought out the eCommerce strategist in me.

## Prologue: Why Combined Postage Matters

One of the best ways to encourage more sales on eBay is to offer **combined postage**. This strategy appeals to buyers who want to grow their collection or save money while shopping.

Combined postage benefits both sides: the buyer saves on shipping, and the seller can increase the **average order value** while using fewer packaging materials.  
It also creates an opportunity to upsell items that might not have sold as quickly on their own.

For collectors, combined postage is especially valuable. Whether someone is reliving childhood memories or shopping for a birthday gift, they appreciate the chance to buy multiple items from the same seller without paying a separate shipping fee for each one.

## Optimising eBay Model Car Sales with Smart Bundling

![Norev 1:43 Scale metallic brown Ford B-Max](#)

Before I began listing each item, I grouped cars that complemented each other in case buyers were interested in purchasing more than one. This **bundling technique** became a core part of my eBay model car sales strategy.  
For example, I paired a **brown Ford B-Max** with a **gold Ford Edge**. These visual or thematic pairings made browsing more appealing and encouraged buyers to explore my other listings.

I also continued to list some of my **Hot Wheels stock** alongside the model Fords. This gave casual collectors an entry point to visit my page, which helped drive additional views.

To maintain efficiency, I applied a consistent method to my photography and editing. Each model car was photographed using the same **lighting and angles** to create a uniform look across the listings. This consistency gave my eBay page a professional appearance and built trust with potential buyers.

Once the photos were ready, I edited them to enhance clarity while staying true to the actual condition of the models. **Accuracy** remained my top priority.

## Listing with Speed and Accuracy

Below is an example of one of the listings I created using my photo-editing workflow and written description:

I created product listings for each Ford and Jaguar model based on the images I had edited. Each listing included important fields such as **brand**, **scale**, **condition**, and **model type**.

To expedite the process of listing multiple cars, I utilised an **AI-generated description draft** as a starting point. This helped reduce time spent writing from scratch. However, I always reviewed and edited each draft carefully.  
I corrected any errors, added important notes such as **"can combine postage"**, and ensured each listing felt accurate and honest.

This approach enabled me to increase my **listing volume** while maintaining a consistent and reliable buyer experience.

## Publishing and Tracking Conversions

![Overall traffic on my eBay page showing: impressions, listing views, quantity sold, click-through-rate and sales conversion rate](#)

Once I had about **100 listings** ready, I waited for the right moment to publish them. I aimed to post them around **5 PM British Summer Time**, particularly during weekends when eBay offered reduced seller fees.

Publishing during this window meant more eyes on my listings and more potential conversions. It also benefited John and me financially, as we paid less in platform fees.

During the sale period, I closely tracked which cars had bids and which buyers were bidding on multiple items. This helped me prepare the right boxes for packaging, especially when orders included several models.

## Single-Item Sales vs. Multi-Item Orders

![Example of a combined order](#)

Single-item orders were easier to package. There was a reduced risk of models rubbing against each other and fewer concerns about display cases being damaged during shipping.

Multi-item orders required more effort. Buyers often messaged me in advance asking, *“How much will postage be if I buy six 1:43 scale Fords?”* The answer was usually **£3.19** for a Royal Mail small parcel, based on 2024–2025 rates. However, heavier parcels would require a slightly higher fee.

There was also additional administrative work involved in updating the total cost and postage on invoices. I had to **weigh the items**, **recalculate shipping**, and **select suitable boxes** with extra packing materials to protect the models in transit.

While more time-consuming, multi-item orders were **well worth the effort**. They reflected buyer trust and helped reduce overall packaging costs.

## Conclusion

![Minichamps 1:43 Scale silver Ford Focus displayed in a white studio](#)

I relied on **intuition**, **experience from selling Hot Wheels**, and a **transparent workflow** to make the most of each listing. Timing was another key factor. Posting listings on **Sunday afternoons** proved far more effective than uploading them during quiet times, such as early mornings on weekdays.

**Combined postage**, **thoughtful bundling**, and **high-quality photos** all played a role in increasing conversion rates and helping more of John’s collection find the right buyers.

In the next part of the series, I’ll talk about what happened when buyers returned for more, how I packaged multi-item orders, and what it was like to manage inventory at scale.
