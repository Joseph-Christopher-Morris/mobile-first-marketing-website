## Scaling My Stock Photography Portfolio: How I Built a Semi-Passive Income Stream

A skyscraper would be a great analogy for my stock photography journey. You have to build the foundations and get your materials to the building site to watch the project unfold over the years.

I didn’t expect stock photography to be easy money. I wanted one thing: a recurring income stream from my creative work.

In Part 1, I explained why I eliminated middlemen like Wirestock. I began licensing directly with Shutterstock, Adobe Stock, and iStock.

In Part 2, I broke down how consistency grew my earnings from **$2.36 in 2022** to **$146.54 in 2023**.

Now, in Part 3, I’ll show you how I scaled my stock photography earnings to over **$1,100** in less than three years. I turned it into a steady side income.

## 📸 Top-Selling Photos (And Why I Think They Worked)

These images showed up in my download reports repeatedly:

### For Sale Sign in Residential Area  
Practical for property listings, blogs, and local news stories.  
**Adobe Stock | 16 downloads | Royalty $11.22.**

### London Stock Exchange Group Crest  
Corporate, financial, and business articles love this kind of image.  
**Shutterstock | 32 Downloads | Royalty $9.46.**

### Row of Audi Cars at Dealership  
Car culture and dealership-related content made this a recurring seller.  
**iStock | 252 Downloads | Royalty $113.60.**

**Why they sold:**  
These images weren’t viral hits; they filled ongoing, evergreen content needs.

- Real estate shots, such as those featuring for-sale signs, work year-round for property listings, blogs, and housing market reports.  
- Corporate signage like the London Stock Exchange image fits financial news, business articles, and investment content.  
- Car dealership rows serve automotive blogs, dealership ads, and car industry features.  

Simple subjects, clean composition, and strong keywords paired with topics that always need fresh visuals. That’s why they sold steadily.
