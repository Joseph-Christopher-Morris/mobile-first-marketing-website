*I used this picture of the Aston Martin on the back of my business card because it's a memorable image.*

While everyone’s shouting on Instagram and dumping budgets into Meta Ads, I tried something wildly simple: **printing flyers**.

**£546 later**, those flyers helped me earn **over £13,500**, landing paid jobs with **race teams, sponsors, and car auctions**.  
Here’s how one bold **offline flyer marketing strategy** outperformed digital tactics—and how you can replicate it.

## 🎯 Background: Building from Zero

After launching *Vivid Auto Photography*, I knew I needed real-world visibility. Instead of relying solely on Instagram or ads, I wanted print materials that felt premium and sparked real conversations at events.

I designed **sleek business cards** and started distributing them during **car meets, races, and track days** like those at *Oulton Park*.  
Every conversation was a touchpoint. Every photo became social proof.

## 🧠 Flyer Strategy That Worked

During the 2020 lockdown, I created a flyer with:

- Premium feel and layout  
- Clean design and strong visual hierarchy  
- A notes section for buyers or collectors to use  
- Personal touches like photos of my dog and high-impact cars  

![Back of Version 1 Flyer – Designed for real conversations. Pricing, FAQs, and portfolio shots (including my Dalmatian) made it more than just a flyer. It was a mini client kit: clear, personal, and built for action.](#)

### Key Image Choices

- **Hyundai i30N** — for cover drama and composition  
- **Audi TTS** — lit to show paint texture  
- **Dalmatian + Porsche 911** — for engagement  
- **Chevy 3500** — standout custom truck build  

These weren’t just flyers. They were **mini‑portfolios with a purpose**.

## 🚀 First Breakthrough Client

Thanks to my Dad handing a flyer to someone in **JSCC team clothing**, I landed my first **paid shoot in October 2020**. That flyer led to:

- The **JSCC Scholarship shoot** (April 2021)  
- **Trackside work at Knockhill Circuit**  
- A surprise second client, **Bathgate Silica Sand**, after a chance encounter  

A single flyer turned into multiple contracts and referrals—all because I showed up prepared.
