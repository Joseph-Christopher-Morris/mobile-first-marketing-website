## Prologue: Selling in Batches

Some listings naturally led to repeat buyers. During the holiday season, **multiple orders** became common as people looked for gifts or wanted to grow their collections.  
Customer feedback reinforced that I was doing something right. **Fair descriptions**, **fast shipping**, and **transparent communication** built loyalty.

## Handling Multi-Item Requests

When buyers placed bids on several cars, I created a **custom invoice** with updated postage. I used **sturdy boxes** with padding to ensure models stayed safe.

**Examples of well‑paired models:**

- White **Minichamps Escort RS Cosworth**  
- Yellow **Minichamps MK1 Mondeo**

## Managing Duplicate Listings

Some buyers asked about models I had already sold. When I had a duplicate, I **reviewed its condition** and **relisted** accordingly.

**Popular repeat sellers included:**

- **MK2 Focus RS**  
- **MK3 Focus ST** *(Minichamps)*  
- **Norev Focus RS MK3*
