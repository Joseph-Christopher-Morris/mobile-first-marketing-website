This article explores my photo setup, editing workflow, and the first signs of customer issues. Learning how to adapt early helped me improve quality and avoid future mistakes.

## Prologue: Lessons from Early Sales

In the first week, **90%** of the cars arrived safely. But two models raised concerns:

- A **Ford Mondeo BTCC** looked more damaged than expected.  
- An **Ultimate Green Ford Focus RS** had paint blemishes and misaligned wheels.

### A mix of positive and constructive feedback

Buyers shared photos of the issues. I issued **full refunds** and arranged returns.  
One buyer, who paired the green Focus RS with a black **RS500**, gave balanced feedback. They appreciated the refund and the honesty of my page.

## Building an eBay Photography Workflow That Scales

To maintain listing quality, I built a reliable eBay photography workflow that allowed me to scale production without losing consistency:

- Set up a **mini studio** with consistent lighting and angles.  
- Use a **Sony A7III** with a **Nikon F-mount lens** for sharp macro shots.  
- **Edit in Lightroom**, enhancing clarity while preserving accuracy.  
- **List strategically**, starting with high-interest models to draw traffic.  

I often listened to music or podcasts during the process to stay focused, especially when aiming to take advantage of eBay's **promotional listing weekends**.

## Managing Efficiency with AI

To speed up descriptions, I used **AI-generated drafts** as starting points. I always reviewed them carefully to correct inaccuracies, add the **“can combine postage”** note, and maintain a personal tone.

This helped me stay productive without compromising quality.

## Conclusion

This phase taught me the importance of sharp photography, detailed editing, and handling customer dissatisfaction with **professionalism**.
