I didn’t start stock photography for exposure. I began for income.  
Commissioned shoots, eBay sales, and even Hot Wheels listings — I wanted another income stream.

Stock photography gave me that — plus patience, sharper instincts, and a new creative edge.

## 📸 Why I Started Stock Photography (It Wasn’t for Exposure)

The reason I wanted to dabble in stock photography was to **diversify my income** from paid commissioned photoshoots, Car And Classic consignments, and selling my Hot Wheels cars.

It was fantastic getting income from these opportunities, but I wanted to expand my expertise and sell my photos on platforms such as **Shutterstock**, **Adobe Stock**, **Alamy**, and **iStock**.

My initial stock photography efforts were on **Wirestock**, where the promotion of having 25 pictures approved on their platform for $5 piqued my interest.

Though I had **416 assets** approved on Wirestock, the time it took for photos to be distributed to agencies like Shutterstock felt overly long — and they took a **15% commission** on top of what agencies such as iStock already charged.

## ❌ Why I Ditched Wirestock for Direct Sales

I decided to sign up directly for **Adobe Stock**, **Shutterstock**, **iStock**, and **Alamy** to sell my photos to people who wanted to licence my assets for various purposes.

I had a photography tutor who acted as a coach, mentor, and sounding board whenever I had questions about:

- How to take the picture  
- How to frame the shot  
- How people could use the photos  
- What the UK photography laws were  
- How to edit the picture in Lightroom Classic

The photos I had ready to sell for my Shutterstock account included images from:  
- The **2022 Oulton Park Gold Cup** event  
- **Trentham Gardens**  
- A **pumpkin field photoshoot**  

Cutting out the middleman provided me with **greater revenue** and also helped me get my pictures **credited online**.
