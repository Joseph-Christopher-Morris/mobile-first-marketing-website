# What I Learned From My Paid Ads Campaign

Paid advertising can be powerful — but only if you know how to **track, measure,
and adapt**.  
On **July 6th, 2025**, I launched two campaigns:

- **Meta Ads** — to promote my
  [eBay case study article](/blog/model-car-case-study).
- **Google Ads** — to drive leads and sign-ups for my free newsletter.

My goal wasn’t instant sales. Instead, I wanted to **drive targeted traffic** to
my site and encourage newsletter sign-ups, where I run **A/B email tests** to
sharpen my marketing skills.

## How I Prepared My Paid Ads Campaign

Before launch, I:

- **Defined my audiences** — hobbyists, collectors, motorsport fans for the
  article; eBay sellers & small business owners for the service ad.
- **Set budgets** — £4.30/day for the article (ad credits), £12.80/day for the
  service (paid budget).
- **Crafted creatives** — clean product shots for the article, service-focused
  imagery for the offer.
- **Optimised landing pages** — Hotjar heatmaps & session recordings helped
  refine layout and reposition my call-to-action (CTA).
- **Improved Google Ads targeting** — Focused on UK cities & niche terms like
  “selling a model car collection.”
