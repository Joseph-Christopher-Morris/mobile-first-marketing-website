One flyer landed my first freelance win.  
The second? It lit the fuse.  

Race teams. Auction gigs. Referrals. Real income.  
All from a refined **flyer marketing strategy** that most people overlook.

In a world inundated with social ads and AI-generated content, **authentic marketing that connects** remains effective. And I've got the results to prove it.

## 🧠 Strategy Behind Flyer Marketing V2

![The front of my Version 2 flyer introduces people to my photography business, gives a summary of me as a photographer and shows the prices of my photography services.](#)

By **April 2021**, I'd covered the **JSCC Scholarships** and shot a **Lamborghini SVJ Roadster**. That gave me stronger material for a better flyer.

### Goals

- Cleaner design and premium feel  
- Better image variety  
- Add real testimonials  

![Back of Version 2 Flyer – Built to build trust fast. Testimonials, standout client results, and over 2 million views helped me show proof, not just promise. It introduced my work, my audience, and what makes my images different.](#)

**Images Featured:**  
- **Cover:** McLaren 650S  
- **Pricing:** Lotus Evora GT410  
- **Featured:** SVJ Roadster, JSCC  
- **Details:** R8 V10, Dalmatian & Lamborghini  
- **About me:** On-location portrait  

I chose each shot to stop thumbs and start conversations.

## 📸 The First Big Win: Hampson Auctions

![Photo I took of the Hampson Auctions Tatton Park stand. A dog is posing in front of a red Ford Escort Mexico rally car with Hampson Auctions sponsorship.](#)

In **August 2021**, I handed my new flyer to **Zach at Hampson Auctions** at the *Tatton Park Classic Car Show*.  
Zach let me shoot their stand on the spot.  

By **August 30th, 2021**, I was covering their **Oulton Park Gold Cup sale** — and I’ve worked with Hampson Auctions ever since.

> "Thanks, Joe. I hope you enjoyed the auction. And thanks for all your help. You're always welcome. You're part of the team."  
> — *Zach Hamilton, Managing Director, Hampson Auctions*

## 🚗 Real Gigs, Real Encounters

![A white Audi TT RS MK2 filmed with an Edelkrone gear at TRAX Silverstone 2021.](#)

At **TRAX Silverstone**, I brought **flyers**, a **Nikon D850**, and **£10,000 of Edelkrone gear**.  
I walked away with the following:

- Paid shoots: *Vauxhall Astra VXR* & *Audi TTRS*  
- Filmed the UK's biggest *Audi R8 meet*  
- Met an auctioneer who later referred me to *Historics Auctioneers*  

All from showing up and talking to people. That was just the start.

## 🏁 The Car & Classic Breakthrough

Duncan’s referral opened the door to **North West Motor Auction**.

> "That's a great picture. Thank you very much! I hope you had a great day and got some good shots. See you next time."
