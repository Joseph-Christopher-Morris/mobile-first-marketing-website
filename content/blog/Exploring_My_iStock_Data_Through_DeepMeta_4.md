## 🧭 Prologue

![DeepMeta 4 Dashboard screenshot segmenting my earnings from my iStock account](#)

I have created a **case study** on my stock photography journey, detailing why I started, my key takeaways, and how my stock photography earnings scaled from **October 2022 to June 2025**.

### Why did I start importing my iStock earnings data to DeepMeta 4?

In **January 2024**, I found navigating my iStock data text files to be unintuitive — especially when compared to using my **Shutterstock** and **Adobe Stock** dashboards.

iStock had dashboards, but they felt outdated and uncompetitive compared to its competitors.  
After a quick Google search, I discovered I could upload my iStock `.txt` data to **DeepMeta 4**, which presented my datasets in a **presentable, intuitive, and informative** manner.

## 📊 Trends Over Time on My iStock Account via DeepMeta 4

![DeepMeta 4 Dashboard segmenting my earnings from my iStock account](#)

For the first twelve months of my iStock account (**March 2023 – March 2024**), I had only a few hundred photos uploaded — not enough data to draw meaningful conclusions.

Shutterstock was different: I had **4,000 images** on that platform.  
Evergreen content such as **MoT signs**, **roadwork images**, and **car showroom shots** consistently generated downloads.

Between **January and March 2024**, I uploaded hundreds of my Shutterstock photos to iStock to increase sales and gather more data.

### Early Trends I Spotted on My iStock Account:
- Car showroom pictures  
- Photos of the high street  
- Images of closed shops in town  

**What connects them?**  
These subjects are highly relevant to publications and individuals creating content.  
A row of cars can serve as a hero image for a dealership’s website, while a “Shop Sale” photo can be licensed for articles about the UK high street.
