# 🚨 Fix GitHub Language Statistics

## The Problem
Your GitHub shows: `JavaScript 56.7%, HTML 31.4%, TypeScript 9.8%`
**This is wrong!** It should show TypeScript as the primary language.

## What's Missing
The main `src/` folder with your React TypeScript components didn't upload properly.

## 🎯 Quick Fix - Upload the Entire src Folder

### Step 1: Go to Your Repository
https://github.com/Joseph-Christopher-Morris/mobile-first-marketing-website

### Step 2: Delete Old Files (If Needed)
If you see individual HTML files or wrong files:
1. Click on each wrong file
2. Click the trash icon to delete
3. Commit the deletion

### Step 3: Upload the Complete src Folder
1. **Click "Add file" → "Upload files"**
2. **Navigate to**: `C:\Users\Joe\Projects\website-sync-20251003_133144`
3. **Drag the ENTIRE `src` folder** (not individual files)
4. **Wait for complete upload**

### Step 4: Also Upload These Essential Folders
- **Drag `public` folder** (contains images)
- **Drag `content` folder** (blog content)
- **Upload `package.json`** (dependencies)
- **Upload `next.config.js`** (build config)
- **Upload `tailwind.config.js`** (styling)
- **Upload `tsconfig.json`** (TypeScript config)

### Step 5: Commit with Message
```
feat: upload complete Next.js TypeScript website

- Added complete src/ folder with all React TypeScript components
- Added public/ folder with all images and assets
- Added content/ folder with blog content
- Added all configuration files
- This is a Next.js TypeScript website, not plain HTML/JS

Repository now contains the complete working website
```

## 🎯 Expected Result After Upload

**Language stats should show:**
- **TypeScript**: 60-70% (your React components)
- **JavaScript**: 15-25% (config files, scripts)
- **CSS**: 5-10% (styling)
- **HTML**: 5% (minimal, just templates)

## 📁 What Should Be in Your Repository

```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── page.tsx          ← TypeScript React
│   ├── about/page.tsx    ← TypeScript React
│   ├── contact/page.tsx  ← TypeScript React
│   ├── blog/page.tsx     ← TypeScript React
│   └── services/         ← More TypeScript
├── components/
│   ├── layout/Header.tsx ← TypeScript React
│   ├── sections/         ← TypeScript React
│   └── ui/               ← TypeScript React
└── lib/                  ← TypeScript utilities

public/
├── images/               ← All your images
└── [other assets]

content/                  ← Blog content
package.json             ← Dependencies
next.config.js           ← Next.js config
tsconfig.json            ← TypeScript config
```

## 🚨 Why This Happened

You likely uploaded:
- ❌ Individual HTML files instead of React components
- ❌ Build output instead of source code
- ❌ Wrong folder or partial upload

## ✅ After Correct Upload

1. **Language stats will be correct**
2. **GitHub Actions will work properly**
3. **ESLint will find the right files**
4. **Build will succeed**
5. **Deployment will work**

**The key is uploading the complete `src/` folder with all your `.tsx` files!**
