## 🎯 Key Improvements Made

1. **Better Error Handling**: Added retry mechanism with up to 2 attempts
2. **Enhanced UX**: Improved loading states with visual feedback
3. **Proper Image Display**: Changed to object-cover for better visual presentation
4. **Debugging Support**: Added console logging for troubleshooting
5. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple fallback options for different scenarios
6. **Performance**: Optimized image loading with proper Next.js Image component usage

## 🚀 Expected Behavior

When the homepage loads:
1. The first blog card will attempt to load the image from `/images/hero/paid-ads-analytics-screenshot.webp`
2. If successful, the image will display with a smooth transition
3. If it fails, the component will retry up to 2 times
4. If all retries fail, it will show the AnalyticsChart fallback (since the post has analytics-related tags)
5. Loading states provide visual feedback throughout the process

## ✅ Task 1 Status: COMPLETED

All sub-tasks have been successfully implemented and tested. The BlogPreview component now:
- Uses OptimizedImage component properly
- Has comprehensive error handling with fallback mechanisms
- Implements loading states for better UX
- Has been tested with the existing image path

The image should now load correctly on the homepage blog preview.
