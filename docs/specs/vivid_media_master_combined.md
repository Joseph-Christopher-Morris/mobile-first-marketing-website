# Combined Google Ads + CRO Master Document

# Vivid Media Cheshire Master Plan
## Google Ads efficiency and website conversion optimisation

**Date range reviewed:** 17 to 21 November 2025  
**Data sources:** Google Ads overview CSV export, GA4 session logs, Microsoft Clarity insights, and your existing CRO plan. fileciteturn3file0

**Purpose:** Reduce wasted spend, raise lead quality, and convert more paid visitors into enquiries.

---

## 1. Key findings from Google Ads CSV export (17 to 18 Nov)

### 1.1 Search intent mismatch is costing you money
Your only paid clicks in this export came from DIY style searches:

- “how to create a website for free” (1 click, £13.21)
- “how to make a website” (1 click, £8.92)

These searches show learning or DIY intent, not a business ready to hire a web designer. This explains the high CPC and low conversions you saw this week.

**Action**
- Add DIY and “free” intent terms as negative keywords (see section 3).
- Push budget into local, service‑intent keywords that already work for you.

---

### 1.2 Local service keywords are present but not winning auctions yet
You received impressions for:

- “web design cheshire”
- “web design crewe”
- “website design in manchester” (impression only)
- other non‑Cheshire locations (impressions only)

These impressions show Google is testing your ads across mixed locations and mixed intent. You need to tighten location and keyword targeting so your budget supports Cheshire buyers.

**Action**
- Limit location targeting to Cheshire East plus a 15 mile radius around Nantwich.
- Exclude out‑of‑area cities by location exclusions and negative location terms.

---

### 1.3 Time of day is very clear
All impressions on Tuesday happened between **9 am and 1 pm**. Monday had almost no traffic.

**Action**
- Run ads Monday to Friday, 9 am to 2 pm.
- Review again after one full week.

---

### 1.4 Device split is balanced, costs are not
For this export:

- Computers: 24 impressions, 2 clicks, £13.84 cost
- Mobile phones: 11 impressions, 2 clicks, £22.13 cost

Mobile CPC is higher than desktop. This usually means mobile visitors bounce faster or struggle to find a next step.

**Action**
- Make sure the main CTA is visible without scrolling on mobile.
- Put tap‑to‑call and email above the form on mobile.

---

### 1.5 Demographic data is thin but suggests DIY skew
Known impressions are mostly:

- 18 to 24 age group (55.56% of known)
- male skew (77.78% of known)

With such a small sample, do not exclude by age or gender yet. The pattern still supports the main issue: you are paying for DIY searches.

**Action**
- Fix intent using keywords and negatives first.
- Revisit demographics after you have 200 to 300 clicks.

---

### 1.6 Locations that saw impressions
Top areas by impressions:

- Alderley Edge / SK9 area
- Crewe
- Sandbach
- Nantwich
- Congleton

These are within your target region.

**Action**
- Keep Cheshire East focus.
- Add ad copy that mentions Nantwich and Cheshire East to reinforce local relevance.

---

## 2. Key findings from GA4 sessions (21 Nov)

You shared four paid sessions. They all landed directly on service or pricing pages and left without converting.

**Patterns**
1. **Very short sessions on services pages**
   - Analytics page visit lasted 7 seconds and only accepted cookies.
   - Website design page visit lasted about 25 seconds, with a brief return.

2. **Contact page visit lasted 2 seconds**
   This suggests the visitor did not see a clear next step or contact method quickly enough on their device.

3. **Pricing page visit lasted 56 seconds**
   The visitor likely read the content but did not feel ready to contact you. You need a low‑friction follow‑up option.

**Action**
- Strengthen above‑the‑fold message match and CTA.
- Add a simple lead magnet to capture “not ready yet” visitors.

---

## 3. Updated negative keyword list (based on real searches)

Add these as campaign‑level negatives.

### 3.1 DIY and learning intent
```
free
for free
how to
how do I
how do you
tutorial
course
learn
example
mockup
best website designs
builder
ai website builder
make my own website
build my own website
```

### 3.2 Out‑of‑area location terms
Only include if you still see these in search terms next week.
```
manchester
stockport
sheffield
buxton
```

### 3.3 Existing software and competitor terms (keep from earlier plan)
```
wix
squarespace
ahrefs
similarweb
semrush
gtmetrix
fasthosts
123 reg
godaddy
bluehost
one.com
login
dashboard
```

---

## 4. Updated keyword focus for next week

### 4.1 Web design campaign (primary)
Exact and phrase match only.

```
[website design cheshire]
[web design cheshire]
[website design nantwich]
[website design crewe]
[web designer near me]
"website designer cheshire"
"web design nantwich"
"small business website design"
```

Pause or lower bids on broad, non‑local terms such as “design your website” until your negative list has worked for a full week.

**Reason**
“Design your website” triggered DIY searches in your export. It is a strong keyword only after negatives control intent.

---

### 4.2 Hosting campaign
```
[website hosting cheshire]
[managed hosting cheshire]
"website maintenance cheshire"
"fast hosting for small business"
```

---

### 4.3 Analytics and Ads campaign
```
[google ads management cheshire]
[ga4 setup cheshire]
[google tag manager cheshire]
"ads tracking setup"
"conversion tracking cheshire"
```

---

## 5. Landing page conversion upgrades for paid visitors

This section extends your CRO plan. fileciteturn3file0

### 5.1 Add Microsoft Clarity trust statement on relevant pages
Add this line under your hero or in your “why choose me” section on:
- Website design
- Analytics
- Hosting
- Services hub

**Copy**
> I use Microsoft Clarity to analyse how visitors interact with your website. I use what I learn to improve the customer journey and increase your chances of getting enquiries.

### 5.2 Add WCAG 2.1 statement on Website Design pages
Add this line near your build process or quality section.

**Copy**
> I follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines when I build websites. I focus on readability, colour contrast, structure, and mobile usability to make the site easier for more people to use.

This supports your positioning around trust and quality. fileciteturn4file0

---

### 5.3 Make the hero section do all the work (mobile first)
Paid visitors decide fast. Do this on every service landing page.

**Checklist**
- Headline matches the ad keyword.
- Main CTA appears without scroll on mobile.
- Short local trust strip sits directly under CTA.
- One secondary CTA only, usually “See examples”.

---

### 5.4 Add a low‑friction lead magnet
The pricing session shows interest without action. Give these visitors a way to raise their hand.

Choose one and place it on:
- Website design page
- Pricing page
- Analytics page

**Options**
- Free website performance and SEO check.
- Free Google Ads and tracking audit.
- Free local visibility check.

Keep it a simple form with 3 to 5 fields.

---

### 5.5 Put a testimonial above the first scroll
Use one short, service‑relevant testimonial card directly under the hero CTA on:
- Website design
- Analytics
- Hosting

Keep each to 2 to 3 lines max, with a headline.

---

## 6. Conversion tracking to support efficiency

### 6.1 GA4 events
Track:
- CTA button clicks
- Phone number clicks
- Form submits
- Lead magnet submits
- Scroll to 50 percent

### 6.2 Import conversions into Google Ads
Import only:
- Form submits
- Phone clicks
- Lead magnet submits

This teaches Google which clicks are valuable.

---

## 7. Weekly optimisation routine

Every Friday:

1. Review Ads search terms. Add new negatives.
2. Check which keyword themes drove micro‑conversions.
3. Watch 5 to 10 Clarity replays from ads traffic.
4. Adjust ad schedule if new peak hours appear.
5. Update landing page copy if a mismatch appears.

---

## 8. What improvement should look like next week

After one week with the new negatives, tighter keywords, and landing fixes, you should see:

- Fewer DIY searches in the search terms report.
- Lower CPC on mobile.
- Longer paid sessions.
- First micro‑conversions, then first enquiries.

## 1) Above‑the‑Fold Fixes (highest impact)

### 1.1 Add a **single, explicit ad‑matching headline**
On each landing page, tighten the hero to mirror likely search intent.

**Website Design page**
Current: “Website Design & Development for Cheshire Businesses” (good) fileciteturn1file2  
**Add a second line:**  
> “Get a fast, lead‑generating website — built locally in Cheshire.”

**Analytics page**
Current hero is strong but broad. fileciteturn1file3  
**Add a sub‑headline focused on ads:**  
> “Track every lead from Google Ads (GA4 + Tag Manager setup included).”

**Hosting page**
Current hero is good and speed‑driven. fileciteturn1file1  
**Add a trust/value line:**

---

### 1.2 Put **one primary CTA** + one secondary (only)

**Secondary CTA** (text/button)

- or **“Call Joe now”** on mobile

Paid visitors need instant reassurance.

**Mini‑strip text (under CTA):**
- “Based in Nantwich • Serving Cheshire East • Reply same day”
- “Certified in GA4 & Adobe Analytics”

Place directly below hero CTA on all landing pages.

---

## 3) Microsoft Clarity‑Driven UX Fixes (apply to all landing pages)

Add these based on typical Clarity findings:
1. **Reduce hero height on mobile**
   Ensure CTA visible without scroll.

2. **Make CTA color contrast maximum**
   (Your pink works — keep it consistent.)

3. **Kill dead zones**
   If Clarity shows rage clicks on non‑clickable elements, either:
   - make them clickable, or  
   - remove hover cues.

4. **Scroll‑prompt hint**
   Small line under hero:
   - “Scroll to see examples ↓”

---

## 4) Message Match Between Ads & Pages

For each ad group, align wording on page to keyword theme:

| Ad theme | Landing page wording to mirror |
|---|---|
| “website design cheshire / nantwich / crewe” | “Website design for Cheshire businesses” + local proof |
| “google ads cheshire” | “Google Ads that bring enquiries for Cheshire SMEs” |
| “ga4 setup / tracking” | “Track every call and form from Ads” |
| “hosting cheshire / fast hosting” | “82% faster hosting with local support” |

This increases Google Ads landing relevance and lowers CPC over time.

---

## 5) Tracking / Analytics Tasks Before Launch

1. **Ensure conversions in GA4**
   - CTA clicks (events)
   - form submits
   - phone taps
2. **Import to Google Ads**
