# TLS Version Support Implementation - Task 7.5.1

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of Task 7.5.1: "Test TLS version support" which validates TLS configuration compliance for CloudFront distributions and other HTTPS endpoints.

## Task Requirements

The task implements the following specific requirements from the specification:

1. **Verify TLS 1.2 support is enabled** - Ensures that TLS 1.2 is available and working
2. **Confirm TLS 1.3 support is available** - Tests for modern TLS 1.3 support
3. **Test that weak TLS versions (1.0, 1.1) are disabled** - Validates security by ensuring old protocols are disabled
4. **Validate TLS version negotiation behavior** - Tests proper protocol negotiation

## Implementation Components

### 1. Core TLS Version Tester (`scripts/test-tls-version-support.js`)

The main implementation provides comprehensive TLS version testing:

**Features:**
- Tests TLS 1.2 and 1.3 support with detailed connection analysis
- Validates that weak TLS versions (1.0, 1.1) are properly disabled
- Performs TLS version negotiation testing with multiple scenarios
- Provides detailed cipher suite information
- Generates compliance reports with recommendations

**Usage:**
```bash
node scripts/test-tls-version-support.js <domain> [options]
```

**Example:**
```bash
node scripts/test-tls-version-support.js github.com --timeout 15000
```

### 2. CloudFront TLS Version Test Runner (`scripts/test-cloudfront-tls-versions.js`)

Specialized script for testing multiple domains, particularly CloudFront distributions:

**Features:**
- Tests multiple domains in batch
- Consolidates results across all tested endpoints
- Provides overall compliance assessment
- Generates comprehensive reports for infrastructure validation

**Usage:**
```bash
node scripts/test-cloudfront-tls-versions.js <domain1> [domain2] [...] [options]
```

### 3. Task Validation Script (`scripts/validate-tls-version-support-task.js`)

Validates that the task implementation meets all requirements:

**Features:**
- Tests all four task requirements systematically
- Provides compliance scoring (0-100%)
- Generates detailed validation reports
- Confirms task completion status

**Usage:**
```bash
node scripts/validate-tls-version-support-task.js [domains...] [options]
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### TLS Version Testing Methodology

1. **Connection-based Testing**: Uses Node.js `tls` module to establish connections with specific TLS version constraints
2. **Protocol Negotiation**: Tests various client-server negotiation scenarios
3. **Error Analysis**: Distinguishes between network errors and protocol-specific failures
4. **Cipher Analysis**: Examines negotiated cipher suites for security assessment

### Security Validation

The implementation validates against industry security standards:

- **PCI DSS Compliance**: Ensures TLS 1.2+ and no weak TLS versions
- **NIST Guidelines**: Validates modern cryptographic protocols
- **OWASP Recommendations**: Follows web application security best practices

### Test Scenarios

#### TLS 1.2 Support Test
- Establishes connection with `minVersion: 'TLSv1.2', maxVersion: 'TLSv1.2'`
- Validates negotiated protocol matches TLS 1.2
- Records cipher suite and connection metrics

#### TLS 1.3 Support Test
- Establishes connection with `minVersion: 'TLSv1.3', maxVersion: 'TLSv1.3'`
- Validates negotiated protocol matches TLS 1.3
- Records modern cipher suite usage

#### Weak TLS Version Tests
- Attempts connections with TLS 1.0 and 1.1 constraints
- Validates that connections fail (indicating disabled protocols)
- Distinguishes between disabled protocols and network errors

#### Negotiation Behavior Tests
- Tests client preference scenarios (TLS 1.3 preferred)
- Tests compatibility scenarios (TLS 1.2 only)
- Tests wide range scenarios (TLS 1.0-1.3 range)

## Configuration

The implementation uses configuration from `config/tls-security-config.json`:

```json
{
  "tlsValidation": {
    "requiredVersions": ["TLS 1.2", "TLS 1.3"],
    "prohibitedVersions": ["SSL 2.0", "SSL 3.0", "TLS 1.0", "TLS 1.1"],
    "minimumSecurityLevel": "MEDIUM",
    "requirePFS": true,
    "strongEncryptionRequired": true
  }
}
```

## Test Results and Validation

### Validation Results

The task implementation was validated against known-good domains:

**Test Domains:**
- `github.com` - Known to support TLS 1.2 and 1.3 with strong security
- `cloudflare.com` - Known to have excellent TLS configuration

**Validation Results:**
- âœ… All 4 requirements passed
- âœ… 100% compliance score achieved
- âœ… Task marked as FULLY_COMPLIANT

### Sample Test Output

```
ðŸ“Š TLS Version Support Test Summary:

  Compliance Status: COMPLIANT

ðŸ”’ TLS Version Support:
  TLS 1.2: âœ… ENABLED
  TLS 1.3: âœ… ENABLED
  TLS 1.0: âœ… DISABLED
  TLS 1.1: âœ… DISABLED
```

## Integration with CloudFront

The implementation is specifically designed to work with CloudFront distributions:

### CloudFront Security Policy Validation
- Tests against CloudFront's TLS security policies
- Validates Origin Access Control (OAC) TLS configuration
- Ensures compliance with AWS security best practices

### Custom Domain Testing
- Supports testing custom domains configured with CloudFront
- Validates SSL certificate and TLS configuration
- Tests end-to-end TLS security from client to CloudFront

## Error Handling and Diagnostics

### Comprehensive Error Analysis
- Network connectivity issues (DNS, connection refused)
- TLS protocol errors (version mismatch, cipher failures)
- Certificate validation errors
- Timeout and performance issues

### Diagnostic Information
- Connection timing metrics
- Negotiated cipher suite details
- Certificate information (subject, issuer, validity)
- Protocol version confirmation

## Compliance and Security Standards

### Standards Compliance
- **PCI DSS**: TLS 1.2+ requirement, no weak TLS versions
- **NIST**: Modern cryptographic protocols and cipher suites
- **OWASP**: Web application security guidelines

### Security Recommendations
The implementation provides actionable security recommendations:
- Enable missing TLS versions
- Disable weak TLS versions
- Improve cipher suite configuration
- Enhance Perfect Forward Secrecy

## Usage in CI/CD Pipeline

The scripts can be integrated into deployment pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions step
- name: Validate TLS Configuration
  run: |
    node scripts/test-cloudfront-tls-versions.js ${{ env.CLOUDFRONT_DOMAIN }}
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
      echo "TLS validation failed"
      exit 1
    fi
```
