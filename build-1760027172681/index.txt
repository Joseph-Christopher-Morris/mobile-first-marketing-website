# What I Learned From My Paid Ads Campaign

Paid advertising can be powerful â€” but only if you know how to track, measure, and adapt. On July 6th, 2025, I launched two campaigns:

**Meta Ads** â€” to promote my eBay case study article.
**Google Ads** â€” to drive leads and sign-ups for my free newsletter.

My goal wasn't instant sales. Instead, I wanted to drive targeted traffic to my site and encourage newsletter sign-ups, where I run A/B email tests to sharpen my marketing skills.

## How I Prepared My Paid Ads Campaign

Before launch, I:

**Defined my audiences** â€” hobbyists, collectors, motorsport fans for the article; eBay sellers & small business owners for the service ad.

**Set budgets** â€” Â£4.30/day for the article (ad credits), Â£12.80/day for the service (paid budget).

**Crafted creatives** â€” clean product shots for the article, service-focused imagery for the offer.

**Optimised landing pages** â€” Hotjar heatmaps & session recordings helped refine layout and reposition my call-to-action (CTA).

**Improved Google Ads targeting** â€” Focused on UK cities & niche terms like "selling a model car collection."

## Results & Insights

### Article Campaign (Meta Ads)
- **Spend**: Â£127.50 ad credit
- **Impressions**: 15,220
- **Clicks**: 446
- **Result**: Boosted article views to 1,318

### Leads Campaign (Google Ads)
- **Spend**: Â£256.91
- **Impressions**: 121,242
- **Clicks**: 1,544
- **Result**: Higher click quality & stronger buying intent

### UX Impact
Hotjar revealed many visitors scrolled past my original CTA. By moving it higher & making it more distinct, newsletter sign-ups improved.

## Key Takeaways

**Data-driven UX changes matter** â€” Optimising user flow directly improved conversion.

**Content vs. Offer** â€” Awareness ads = cheaper clicks; direct offers = higher intent.

**Keyword exclusions save budget** â€” Removing irrelevant search terms cut wasted spend.

**Run ads directly** â€” Avoid extra fees from third-party ad managers like Wix Ads.

**Email list growth compounds** â€” Every sign-up means future test opportunities & leads.

## Final Thoughts

This campaign proved that ads, UX optimisation, and targeting refinements work best together. By combining Meta Ads, Google Ads, and Hotjar insights, I turned paid traffic into lasting audience growth â€” and learned how to make my next campaign even stronger.

# How I Turned Â£546 into Â£13.5K With Flyers: Year-by-Year ROI Breakdown (2021â€“2025)

Sometimes the simplest marketing strategies deliver the biggest results. Over the past four years, I've invested Â£546 in strategic flyer campaigns that generated Â£13,500 in direct revenueâ€”a 2,472% ROI that proves traditional marketing still works in our digital world.

## The Strategy Behind the Success

### Year 1 (2021): Testing the Waters
**Investment**: Â£89
**Revenue**: Â£1,200
**ROI**: 1,348%

Started with targeted flyer drops in high-value neighborhoods, focusing on quality over quantity. Each flyer was designed with a clear value proposition and strong call-to-action.

### Year 2 (2022): Scaling What Works
**Investment**: Â£156
**Revenue**: Â£3,800
**ROI**: 2,436%

Doubled down on successful areas and refined the messaging based on customer feedback. Introduced seasonal campaigns and limited-time offers.

### Year 3 (2023): Strategic Expansion
**Investment**: Â£178
**Revenue**: Â£4,200
**ROI**: 2,360%

Expanded to new territories while maintaining focus on proven demographics. Added QR codes for tracking and integrated with digital follow-up campaigns.

### Year 4 (2024): Optimization & Growth
**Investment**: Â£123
**Revenue**: Â£4,300
**ROI**: 3,496%

Streamlined operations, improved targeting, and achieved the highest ROI yet through data-driven optimization.

## Key Success Factors

### 1. Precise Targeting
- Demographic research before each campaign
- Geographic analysis of response rates
- Timing optimization based on local patterns

### 2. Compelling Design
- Clear, benefit-focused headlines
- Professional photography and layout
- Strong call-to-action with urgency

### 3. Tracking & Measurement
- Unique phone numbers for each campaign
- QR codes linking to landing pages
- Customer surveys to understand decision factors

### 4. Follow-Up Systems
- Immediate response protocols
- Email capture for nurturing
- Referral incentive programs

## Lessons Learned

**Quality Beats Quantity**: 500 well-targeted flyers outperform 2,000 generic ones every time.

**Consistency Wins**: Regular, smaller campaigns build brand recognition better than sporadic large drops.

**Local Knowledge Matters**: Understanding your community's preferences and timing is crucial.

**Integration Amplifies**: Combining flyers with digital follow-up multiplies effectiveness.

## The Numbers Don't Lie

- **Total Investment**: Â£546
- **Total Revenue**: Â£13,500
- **Overall ROI**: 2,472%
- **Average Cost Per Acquisition**: Â£12.15
- **Customer Lifetime Value**: Â£450

## Actionable Takeaways

1. **Start Small**: Test with Â£50-100 in a focused area
2. **Track Everything**: Use unique identifiers to measure results
3. **Iterate Quickly**: Adjust based on response data
4. **Think Long-Term**: Build relationships, not just transactions
5. **Stay Consistent**: Regular presence builds trust and recognition

## The Future of Flyer Marketing

While digital marketing dominates the conversation, physical marketing materials still cut through the noise. In an increasingly digital world, a well-designed flyer in someone's hands creates a tangible connection that emails and ads can't match.

Ready to start your own flyer campaign? The key is starting small, measuring everything, and scaling what works.

### What Stock Photography Teaches Us

**Universal Appeal**: The most successful stock images solve common visual problems across multiple industries and use cases.

**Technical Excellence**: Every image must meet strict technical standardsâ€”sharp focus, proper exposure, and professional composition.

**Emotional Connection**: Images that evoke specific emotions or tell clear stories consistently outperform purely aesthetic shots.

**Versatility**: The best images work across multiple contexts and can be used for various purposes.

## Key Lessons for Automotive Photography

### 1. Composition for Multiple Uses

Stock photography teaches us to compose images that work in various formats and applications:

- **Horizontal and vertical versions** of key shots
- **Space for text overlay** in strategic areas
- **Multiple focal points** that allow for different cropping options
- **Clean backgrounds** that don't compete with the subject

### 2. Lighting for Broad Appeal

**Consistent, Professional Lighting**
- Even illumination that shows all important details
- Minimal harsh shadows that could limit usability
- Color temperature that works across different contexts

**Mood Through Light**
- Golden hour for aspirational, lifestyle imagery
- Clean, bright lighting for commercial applications
- Dramatic lighting for performance and luxury positioning

### 3. Technical Standards

**Image Quality Requirements**
