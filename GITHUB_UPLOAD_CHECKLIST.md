# 🚀 GitHub Upload Checklist - Fix Deployment

## ❗ CRITICAL: Your GitHub repository is missing the source code!

### 📋 Files/Folders to Upload Immediately:

#### 1. **MOST CRITICAL - Source Code**

- [ ] `src/` folder (entire folder with all contents)
  - This contains your React components, pages, and all source code
  - **Without this, Amplify has nothing to build!**

#### 2. **Updated Configuration Files**

- [ ] `next.config.js` (updated with our fixes)
- [ ] `package.json` (updated with our fixes)
- [ ] `src/app/robots.ts` (with static export config)
- [ ] `src/app/sitemap.ts` (with static export config)

#### 3. **Other Essential Folders**

- [ ] `public/` folder (images and static assets)
- [ ] `content/` folder (your content files)
- [ ] `scripts/` folder (build and deployment scripts)

### 🎯 Quick Upload Method:

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Click "Add file" → "Upload files"**
3. **Drag and drop these folders/files:**
   - Entire `src` folder
   - `public` folder
   - `content` folder
   - `scripts` folder
   - Updated `next.config.js`
   - Updated `package.json`

4. **Commit with message:** "Add source code and fix build configuration"
5. **Push/commit the changes**

### ✅ After Upload:

- AWS Amplify will automatically detect the changes
- It will trigger a new build
- The build should now succeed because it has the source code

### 🔍 Verify Upload:

Check that your GitHub repository now shows:

- `src/app/` folder with page files
- `src/components/` folder with React components
- `src/lib/` folder with utilities
- `public/images/` folder with images
- All the configuration files

### 🚨 Why This Happened:

Your local environment has all the files, but they weren't uploaded to GitHub.
AWS Amplify builds from GitHub, so it needs all the source code to be in the
repository.

**Once you upload these files, your deployment should work! 🎉**
