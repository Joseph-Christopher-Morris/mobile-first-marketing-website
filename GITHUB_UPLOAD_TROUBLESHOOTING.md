# üö® GitHub Upload Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: Upload Fails or Times Out**

**Symptoms:**
- Files don't upload completely
- Browser shows error messages
- Upload progress stops

**Solutions:**
1. **Try smaller batches:**
   - Upload `src/` folder first (most important)
   - Then upload `public/` folder
   - Finally upload config files individually

2. **Check file size:**
   - GitHub has 100MB file limit
   - If any single file is too large, skip it for now

3. **Use different browser:**
   - Try Chrome, Firefox, or Edge
   - Clear browser cache first

### **Issue 2: Language Stats Still Wrong After Upload**

**Symptoms:**
- Still shows JavaScript/HTML as primary
- TypeScript percentage is low

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify src/ folder uploaded:**
   - Check that `src/app/`, `src/components/`, `src/lib/` are visible
   - Look for `.tsx` files in the repository

2. **Wait for GitHub to process:**
   - Language stats can take 5-10 minutes to update
   - Refresh the repository page

3. **Check what actually uploaded:**
   - Browse through your repository files
   - Make sure you see TypeScript files, not HTML files

### **Issue 3: GitHub Actions Not Triggering**

**Symptoms:**
- No workflow runs in Actions tab
- Build doesn't start automatically

**Solutions:**
1. **Check .github folder uploaded:**
   - Look for `.github/workflows/s3-cloudfront-deploy.yml`
   - If missing, upload the `.github` folder

2. **Verify main branch:**
   - Workflow triggers on pushes to `main` branch
   - Make sure you're committing to the right branch

### **Issue 4: ESLint Errors Still Occurring**

**Symptoms:**
- Build fails with ESLint errors
- Quality checks don't pass

**Solutions:**
1. **Upload the fixed files:**
   - Make sure you uploaded the corrected versions
   - Check that `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` has the fixes

2. **Verify .eslintrc.json uploaded:**
   - This file contains the ESLint configuration
   - Without it, different rules might apply

### **Issue 5: Images Not Loading After Deployment**

**Symptoms:**
- Website deploys but images are broken
- 404 errors for image files

**Solutions:**
1. **Check public/images/ folder:**
   - Verify all image files uploaded
   - Check file names match exactly (case-sensitive)

2. **Verify image paths in code:**
   - Make sure image references are correct
   - Check that build process includes images

## üîß **Quick Fixes**

### **If Upload Completely Failed:**
1. Delete any partial files in GitHub
2. Start fresh with just the `src/` folder
3. Add other files one by one

### **If Language Stats Are Wrong:**
1. Check what files are actually in the repository
2. Delete any HTML files that shouldn't be there
3. Re-upload the `src/` folder

### **If Build Fails:**
1. Check the Actions tab for error details
2. Look for specific ESLint or build errors
3. Upload the corrected files

## üÜò **Emergency Reset**

If everything goes wrong:

1. **Delete all files from GitHub repository**
2. **Start with minimal upload:**
   - Just `src/` folder
   - Just `package.json`
   - Just `next.config.js`
3. **Verify these work first**
4. **Then add remaining files**

## üìû **Validation Commands**

After upload, run this to check if everything worked:
```bash
node scripts/validate-github-upload.js
```

This will tell you:
- ‚úÖ What uploaded correctly
- ‚ùå What's missing
- üìä Language statistics
- üîç File structure validation

## üéØ **Success Indicators**

You'll know the upload worked when:
- ‚úÖ Language stats show TypeScript as primary (60%+)
- ‚úÖ Repository has 50+ files
- ‚úÖ `src/app/`, `src/components/`, `src/lib/` folders visible
- ‚úÖ `public/images/` folder contains your images
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions workflow appears in Actions tab
- ‚úÖ First workflow run starts automatically

## üí° **Pro Tips**

1. **Upload during off-peak hours** - GitHub is faster
2. **Use wired internet connection** - more stable than WiFi
3. **Close other browser tabs** - reduces memory usage
4. **Upload `src/` folder first** - it's the most critical
5. **Don't panic if it takes time** - large uploads can be slow
