    'Discover how I used Meta Ads, Google Ads, and UX insights to drive qualified traffic, grow my newsletter, and improve future marketing campaigns.',

    <p>Paid advertising can be powerful â€” but only if you know how to <strong>track, measure, and adapt</strong>.<br />
    On <strong>July 6th, 2025</strong>, I launched two campaigns:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Meta Ads</strong> â€” to promote my <a href="/blog/model-car-case-study">eBay case study article</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Ads</strong> â€” to drive leads and sign-ups for my free newsletter.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>My goal wasn't instant sales. Instead, I wanted to <strong>drive targeted traffic</strong> to my site and encourage newsletter sign-ups, where I run <strong>A/B email tests</strong> to sharpen my marketing skills.</p>
    
    <h2>How I Prepared My Paid Ads Campaign</h2>
    <p>Before launch, I:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Defined my audiences</strong> â€” hobbyists, collectors, motorsport fans for the article; eBay sellers & small business owners for the service ad.</li>
      <li><strong>Set budgets</strong> â€” Â£4.30/day for the article (ad credits), Â£12.80/day for the service (paid budget).</li>
      <li><strong>Crafted creatives</strong> â€” clean product shots for the article, service-focused imagery for the offer.</li>
      <li><strong>Optimised landing pages</strong> â€” Hotjar heatmaps & session recordings helped refine layout and reposition my call-to-action (CTA).</li>
      <li><strong>Improved Google Ads targeting</strong> â€” Focused on UK cities & niche terms like "selling a model car collection."</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Results & Insights</h2>
    
    <h3>Article Campaign (Meta Ads)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Spend:</strong> Â£127.50 ad credit</li>
      <li><strong>Impressions:</strong> 15,220</li>
      <li><strong>Clicks:</strong> 446</li>
      <li><strong>Result:</strong> Boosted article views to 1,318</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Leads Campaign (Google Ads)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Spend:</strong> Â£256.91</li>
      <li><strong>Impressions:</strong> 121,242</li>
      <li><strong>Clicks:</strong> 1,544</li>
      <li><strong>Result:</strong> Higher click quality & stronger buying intent</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>UX Impact</h3>
    <p>Hotjar revealed many visitors <strong>scrolled past my original CTA</strong>.<br />
    By moving it higher & making it more distinct, <strong>newsletter sign-ups improved</strong>.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data-driven UX changes matter</strong> â€” Optimising user flow directly improved conversion.</li>
      <li><strong>Content vs. Offer</strong> â€” Awareness ads = cheaper clicks; direct offers = higher intent.</li>
      <li><strong>Keyword exclusions save budget</strong> â€” Removing irrelevant search terms cut wasted spend.</li>
      <li><strong>Run ads directly</strong> â€” Avoid extra fees from third-party ad managers like Wix Ads.</li>
      <li><strong>Email list growth compounds</strong> â€” Every sign-up means future test opportunities & leads.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>This campaign proved that <strong>ads, UX optimisation, and targeting refinements</strong> work best together.<br />
    By combining <strong>Meta Ads, Google Ads, and Hotjar insights</strong>, I turned paid traffic into lasting audience growth â€” and learned how to make my next campaign even stronger.</p>
