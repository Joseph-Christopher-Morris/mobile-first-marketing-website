# What I Learned From My Paid Ads Campaign

Paid advertising can be powerful â€” but only if you know how to track, measure, and adapt. On July 6th, 2025, I launched two campaigns:

**Meta Ads** â€” to promote my eBay case study article.
**Google Ads** â€” to drive leads and sign-ups for my free newsletter.

My goal wasn't instant sales. Instead, I wanted to drive targeted traffic to my site and encourage newsletter sign-ups, where I run A/B email tests to sharpen my marketing skills.

## How I Prepared My Paid Ads Campaign

Before launch, I:

**Defined my audiences** â€” hobbyists, collectors, motorsport fans for the article; eBay sellers & small business owners for the service ad.

**Set budgets** â€” Â£4.30/day for the article (ad credits), Â£12.80/day for the service (paid budget).

**Crafted creatives** â€” clean product shots for the article, service-focused imagery for the offer.

**Optimised landing pages** â€” Hotjar heatmaps & session recordings helped refine layout and reposition my call-to-action (CTA).

**Improved Google Ads targeting** â€” Focused on UK cities & niche terms like "selling a model car collection."

## Results & Insights

### Article Campaign (Meta Ads)
- **Spend**: Â£127.50 ad credit
- **Impressions**: 15,220
- **Clicks**: 446
- **Result**: Boosted article views to 1,318

### Leads Campaign (Google Ads)
- **Spend**: Â£256.91
- **Impressions**: 121,242
- **Clicks**: 1,544
- **Result**: Higher click quality & stronger buying intent

### UX Impact
Hotjar revealed many visitors scrolled past my original CTA. By moving it higher & making it more distinct, newsletter sign-ups improved.

## Key Takeaways

**Data-driven UX changes matter** â€” Optimising user flow directly improved conversion.

**Content vs. Offer** â€” Awareness ads = cheaper clicks; direct offers = higher intent.

**Keyword exclusions save budget** â€” Removing irrelevant search terms cut wasted spend.

**Run ads directly** â€” Avoid extra fees from third-party ad managers like Wix Ads.

**Email list growth compounds** â€” Every sign-up means future test opportunities & leads.

## Final Thoughts

This campaign proved that ads, UX optimisation, and targeting refinements work best together. By combining Meta Ads, Google Ads, and Hotjar insights, I turned paid traffic into lasting audience growth â€” and learned how to make my next campaign even stronger.
