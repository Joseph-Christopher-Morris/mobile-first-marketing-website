    <p>While everyone's shouting on Instagram and dumping budgets into Meta Ads, I tried something wildly simple: <strong>printing flyers</strong>.</p>

    <p><em>I used this picture of the Aston Martin on the back of my business card because it's a memorable image.</em></p>

    <p><strong>£546 later</strong>, those flyers helped me earn <strong>over £13,500</strong>, landing paid jobs with <strong>race teams, sponsors, and car auctions</strong>.<br />
    Here's how one bold <strong>offline flyer marketing strategy</strong> outperformed digital tactics—and how you can replicate it.</p>

    <h2>🎯 Background: Building from Zero</h2>

    <p>After launching <em>Vivid Media Cheshire</em>, I knew I needed real-world visibility. Instead of relying solely on Instagram or ads, I wanted print materials that felt premium and sparked real conversations at events.</p>

    <p>I designed <strong>sleek business cards</strong> and started distributing them during <strong>car meets, races, and track days</strong> like those at <em>Oulton Park</em>.<br />
    Every conversation was a touchpoint. Every photo became social proof.</p>

    <h2>🧠 Flyer Strategy That Worked</h2>

    <p>During the 2020 lockdown, I created a flyer with:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Premium feel and layout</li>
      <li>Clean design and strong visual hierarchy</li>
      <li>A notes section for buyers or collectors to use</li>
      <li>Personal touches like photos of my dog and high-impact cars</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Image Choices</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hyundai i30N</strong> — for cover drama and composition</li>
      <li><strong>Audi TTS</strong> — lit to show paint texture</li>
      <li><strong>Dalmatian + Porsche 911</strong> — for engagement</li>
      <li><strong>Chevy 3500</strong> — standout custom truck build</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These weren't just flyers. They were <strong>mini‑portfolios with a purpose</strong>.</p>

    <h2>🚀 First Breakthrough Client</h2>

    <p>Thanks to my Dad handing a flyer to someone in <strong>JSCC team clothing</strong>, I landed my first <strong>paid shoot in October 2020</strong>. That flyer led to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>JSCC Scholarship shoot</strong> (April 2021)</li>
      <li><strong>Trackside work at Knockhill Circuit</strong></li>
      <li>A surprise second client, <strong>Bathgate Silica Sand</strong>, after a chance encounter</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A single flyer turned into multiple contracts and referrals—all because I showed up prepared.</p>

    <h2>📬 Why Physical Marketing Still Wins</h2>

    <p>People remember what they can <strong>touch</strong>. My flyers broke through the digital noise and:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Led to <strong>£13.5K in tracked revenue</strong></li>
      <li>Attracted <strong>sponsors, race teams, and classic car collectors</strong></li>
      <li>Proved that <strong>authentic branding + great timing beats big ad budgets</strong></li>
    </ul>
