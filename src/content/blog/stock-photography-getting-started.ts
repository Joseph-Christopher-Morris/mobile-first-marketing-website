    <p>I didn't start stock photography for exposure. I began for income.<br />
    Commissioned shoots, eBay sales, and even Hot Wheels listings — I wanted another income stream.</p>

    <p>Stock photography gave me that — plus patience, sharper instincts, and a new creative edge.</p>

    <h2>📸 Why I Started Stock Photography (It Wasn't for Exposure)</h2>

    <img src="/images/blog/Shutterstock_Downloads_Earnings_Jan_Apr_2023.webp" alt="Vivid Brands Wirestock storefront with earnings and downloads" />

    <p>The reason I wanted to dabble in stock photography was to <strong>diversify my income</strong> from paid commissioned photoshoots, Car And Classic consignments, and selling my Hot Wheels cars.</p>

    <p>It was fantastic getting income from these opportunities, but I wanted to expand my expertise and sell my photos on platforms such as <strong>Shutterstock</strong>, <strong>Adobe Stock</strong>, <strong>Alamy</strong>, and <strong>iStock</strong>.</p>

    <p>My initial stock photography efforts were on <strong>Wirestock</strong>, where the promotion of having 25 pictures approved on their platform for $5 piqued my interest.</p>

    <p>Though I had <strong>416 assets</strong> approved on Wirestock, the time it took for photos to be distributed to agencies like Shutterstock felt overly long — and they took a <strong>15% commission</strong> on top of what agencies such as iStock already charged.</p>

    <h2>❌ Why I Ditched Wirestock for Direct Sales</h2>

    <p><em>My first direct sales on Shutterstock — proof that cutting out the middleman was the right decision.</em></p>

    <p>I decided to sign up directly for <strong>Adobe Stock</strong>, <strong>Shutterstock</strong>, <strong>iStock</strong>, and <strong>Alamy</strong> to sell my photos to people who wanted to licence my assets for various purposes.</p>

    <p>I had a photography tutor who acted as a coach, mentor, and sounding board whenever I had questions about:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>How to take the picture</li>
      <li>How to frame the shot</li>
      <li>How people could use the photos</li>
      <li>What the UK photography laws were</li>
      <li>How to edit the picture in Lightroom Classic</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The photos I had ready to sell for my Shutterstock account included images from:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>2022 Oulton Park Gold Cup</strong> event</li>
      <li><strong>Trentham Gardens</strong></li>
      <li>A <strong>pumpkin field photoshoot</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Cutting out the middleman provided me with <strong>greater revenue</strong> and also helped me get my pictures <strong>credited online</strong>.</p>

    <h2>💵 My 2022 Stock Photo Sales (and What They Taught Me)</h2>

    <p>Here's how stock photography grew from <strong>$0 to slow, steady income</strong> and what the numbers looked like.</p>

    <p><strong>2022 Shutterstock Revenue Earnings (Cumulative Chart)</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>November 2022:</strong> 4 downloads — $1.13</li>
      <li><strong>December 2022:</strong> 10 downloads — $1.23</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧠 What Stock Photography Really Taught Me</h2>

    <img src="/images/blog/230210_Stoke_Car_Photography-9.webp" alt="Everyday street scene showing the type of mundane content that sells consistently" />
    <p><em>This type of everyday scene — a closed shop on a high street — consistently outsold more "artistic" shots.</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lesson 1: Patience pays.</strong> Sales come slow. That's part of the game.</li>
      <li><strong>Lesson 2: The mundane sells.</strong> Skips and signs often beat fancy car shots.</li>
      <li><strong>Lesson 3: You don't know what wins.</strong> Buyers surprise you — like when a roadwork sign outsold my best edits.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🎯 Final Take: How Stock Photography Changed My Mindset</h2>

    <p>Many people have a multitude of reasons to begin stock photography.<br />
    My case was to <strong>diversify income</strong>, <strong>supplement cash flow</strong>, and <strong>do something I enjoy</strong>.</p>

    <p>The journey was up and down — akin to a roller coaster.<br />
    But I learned a lot by diversifying what I shoot, how I frame pictures, the way I write descriptions, and how I approach photoshoots mentally.</p>

    <p>Stock photography wasn't a side hustle — it was a <strong>mindset shift</strong>.</p>
