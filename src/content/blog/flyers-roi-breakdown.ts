    <p>One flyer got me started.<br />

    📈 Year-by-year revenue (2021–2025)<br />
    💡 The moments that worked — and didn't</p>
    <p>This isn't theory. It's <strong>£13.5K made from £546 in print costs.</strong></p>
    <h2>🚀 Flyer V3: Built to Scale</h2>
    <img src="/images/blog/211125_Hampson_Auctions-29.webp" alt="Porsche 911 at the Hampson Auctions Concorde Conference Centre Sale: November 2021" />
    <p>By early 2023, I'd levelled up my content and my clients.</p>
    <p>I had repeated work with Car & Classic, stronger visuals, and better grammar. Time to scale.</p>
    <p><strong>Flyer V3 Goals:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>More varied, premium images</li>
      <li>Tighter writing</li>
      <li>A show-stopping cover</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I chose each image to <strong>create emotion, not just fill space.</strong></p>
    <h2>⚠️ NEC Show Roadbump</h2>
    <img src="/images/blog/230112_NEC_Autoshow-132.webp" alt="The Praga R1R race car at the ROWE trade stand at the NEC Autosport International show" />
    <p>Right before the NEC Autosport International, Vistaprint emailed me:</p>
    <blockquote>"Can't print in time."</blockquote>
    <p>I called, got it sorted, and got refunded.<br />
    But by show day, only the old flyers were ready.</p>
    <p>The NEC didn't deliver many leads, but it was still worth attending. I met passionate people and saw the best of motorsport tech — <strong>still a win.</strong></p>
    <h2>📉 The Client Who Didn't Pay… At First</h2>
    <p>Not every lead is golden.</p>
    <p>Bidding Classics found me via LinkedIn. I delivered the work. Then came the silence.</p>
    <p>Like other photographers, I chased overdue invoices and eventually had to file a CCJ.<br />
    It worked — I got paid. But it reminded me that not every flashy brand respects your time.</p>
    <p>That experience sharpened my filters. Now I vet leads more thoroughly and focus on clients who <strong>value the craft.</strong></p>
    <h2>💰 Flyer Revenue by Year</h2>
    <p>From <strong>£780 in year one to nearly £6K in year three</strong> — proof that smart print strategy and persistence can outperform paid ads.</p>

    <p><em>Total revenue from flyers: <strong>£13,563.92</strong> — a <strong>2,380% ROI</strong>.</em></p>
    <h2>🧩 Key Takeaways</h2>
    <img src="/images/blog/230112_NEC_Autoshow-62.webp" alt="A Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 RS and a McLaren Senna at the Logic stand at NEC Autosport International" />
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Flyers made me visible in high-trust spaces.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>My portfolio fed word-of-mouth.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Referrals snowballed into real money.</strong></li>
      <li>I shifted from lead-chasing to <strong>upskilling in digital marketing</strong>, but flyers kept working in the background.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That's how I turned <strong>£546 into £13,563.92</strong> — a <strong>2,380% return</strong>.<br />
    Without Google Ads, Meta boosts or influencers.</p>

    <h2>🔍 A Note on ROI Context and Future Expectations</h2>
    <p>That <strong>2,380% ROI</strong> was possible because this flyer campaign started at a very specific point in my business journey.</p>
    <p>At the time, I was building from <strong>zero clients</strong>, already had my <strong>equipment and software paid for</strong>, and invested <strong>£546 total</strong>, including around <strong>£200 on flyers</strong>. Every booking represented new revenue, which naturally amplified the percentage return.</p>
    <p>If I were to run a new flyer marketing campaign today for <strong>Vivid Media Cheshire</strong>, I would expect a more realistic return in the region of <strong>100% to 200% ROI</strong>, based on higher operating costs, a mature service offering, and different growth constraints.</p>
    <p>For a <strong>community-led campaign</strong>, such as a <strong>NYCC venue booking drive</strong>, where the goal is awareness and utilisation rather than pure profit, a <strong>50% ROI</strong> would be a reasonable and healthy outcome.</p>
    <p>The key takeaway is not the headline percentage. It is that <strong>offline marketing worked consistently</strong>, scaled over time, and remained effective even as my focus shifted toward digital marketing.</p>
