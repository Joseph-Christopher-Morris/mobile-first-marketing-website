    <p>One flyer got me started.<br />
    The third? It fuelled my highest-earning years yet.</p>
    
    <p>📦 Third flyer design<br />
    📈 Year-by-year revenue (2021–2025)<br />
    💡 The moments that worked — and didn't</p>
    
    <p>This isn't theory. It's <strong>£13.5K made from £546 in print costs.</strong></p>
    
    <h2>🚀 Flyer V3: Built to Scale</h2>

    <p>By early 2023, I'd levelled up my content and my clients.</p>
    
    <p>I had repeated work with Car & Classic, stronger visuals, and better grammar. Time to scale.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Flyer V3 Goals:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>More varied, premium images</li>
      <li>Tighter writing</li>
      <li>A show-stopping cover</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="/images/blog/flyer-v3-back.jpg" alt="Back of Version 3 Flyer — Proof over promise" />
    
    <p>I chose each image to <strong>create emotion, not just fill space.</strong></p>
    
    <h2>⚠️ NEC Show Roadbump</h2>
    
    <img src="/images/blog/praga-r1r-nec.jpg" alt="The Praga R1R race car at the ROWE trade stand at the NEC Autosport International show" />
    
    <p>Right before the NEC Autosport International, Vistaprint emailed me:</p>
    <blockquote>"Can't print in time."</blockquote>
    
    <p>I called, got it sorted, and got refunded.<br />
    But by show day, only the old flyers were ready.</p>
    
    <p>The NEC didn't deliver many leads, but it was still worth attending. I met passionate people and saw the best of motorsport tech — <strong>still a win.</strong></p>
    
    <h2>📉 The Client Who Didn't Pay… At First</h2>
    <p>Not every lead is golden.</p>
    
    <p>Bidding Classics found me via LinkedIn. I delivered the work. Then came the silence.</p>
    
    <p>Like other photographers, I chased overdue invoices and eventually had to file a CCJ.<br />
    It worked — I got paid. But it reminded me that not every flashy brand respects your time.</p>
    
    <p>That experience sharpened my filters. Now I vet leads more thoroughly and focus on clients who <strong>value the craft.</strong></p>
    
    <h2>💰 Flyer Revenue by Year</h2>
    <p>From <strong>£780 in year one to nearly £6K in year three</strong> — proof that smart print strategy and persistence can outperform paid ads.</p>
