    <p><em>Behind the Scenes: Business, Admin, and Buyer Challenges</em></p>



    <p>In this final article, I reveal what it was like to run the project from the inside. Running an eBay model car selling business, especially when handling someone else's collection, meant balancing <strong>fairness</strong>, <strong>admin</strong>, and <strong>patience</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Prologue: Slow Sales, New Insights</h2>

    <p>By week five, most of the collection had sold. A few cars remained due to <strong>niche appeal</strong> or <strong>unclear market value</strong>. For models with limited data, I used my <strong>instincts</strong> to set prices.</p>

    <h2>Commission and Payment Tracking in My eBay Model Car Selling Business</h2>

    <p>John and I agreed on a <strong>75/25 split</strong>. I managed everything:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Photography</li>
      <li>Customer service</li>
      <li>Packaging</li>
      <li>Listings</li>
      <li>Postage</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>The commission tracker I used to maintain transparency — every sale, fee, and payment documented with John's approval.</em></p>

    <p>An example from the <strong>commission tracker</strong> was shared with John. I used this spreadsheet to track every sale, deduct postage and fees, and ensure that payments were <strong>fair and transparent</strong>.</p>

    <p>To maintain transparency, I used an <strong>Excel spreadsheet</strong> to track every sale. It listed the model, sale price, postage cost, and our respective shares. I printed this out and reviewed it with John directly.</p>

    <p><strong>Payments</strong> were sent after a <strong>seven-day buffer</strong> to account for any potential returns.</p>

    <h2>Emotional and Practical Challenges</h2>

    <p><em>Damaged parcel reality — operational challenges that required professional handling and transparent communication with both buyers and John.</em></p>

    <p>There was emotional weight to selling someone else's collection. I wanted to do right by John. At the same time, I had to deal with:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Buyers placing offers, then disappearing</li>
      <li>Questions without follow‑up</li>
      <li>Returns and refund requests</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I stayed calm and professional, cancelling unpaid orders after a grace period and <strong>relisting</strong> them during eBay's <strong>promotional windows</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>



    <p>Selling John's collection was a hands‑on, emotionally complex experience. It taught me how to <strong>manage customer relationships</strong>, <strong>promote business transparency</strong>, and <strong>effectively present products</strong> simultaneously.</p>

    <p>John got funds for his home improvement project. I gained experience, income, and a story worth sharing.</p>
