    <p>Over <strong>1,100 downloads</strong> across 24 months have earned me <strong>$484.05</strong> in royalties on iStock.<br />
    This article explores my journey and what the data reveals in <strong>DeepMeta 4</strong>.</p>

    <h2>🧭 Prologue</h2>
    <img src="/images/blog/Cumulative_Stock_Photography_Revenue_2022_2025_v2.webp?v=20251217" alt="DeepMeta 4 Dashboard screenshot segmenting my earnings from my iStock account" class="analytics-screenshot" />
    <p>I have created a <strong>case study</strong> on my stock photography journey, detailing why I started, my key takeaways, and how my stock photography earnings scaled from <strong>October 2022 to June 2025</strong>.</p>
    <h3>Why did I start importing my iStock earnings data to DeepMeta 4?</h3>
    <p>In <strong>January 2024</strong>, I found navigating my iStock data text files to be unintuitive — especially when compared to using my <strong>Shutterstock</strong> and <strong>Adobe Stock</strong> dashboards.</p>
    <p>iStock had dashboards, but they felt outdated and uncompetitive compared to its competitors.<br />
    After a quick Google search, I discovered I could upload my iStock <code>.txt</code> data to <strong>DeepMeta 4</strong>, which presented my datasets in a <strong>presentable, intuitive, and informative</strong> manner.</p>
    <h2>📊 Trends Over Time on My iStock Account via DeepMeta 4</h2>

    <p>For the first twelve months of my iStock account (<strong>March 2023 – March 2024</strong>), I had only a few hundred photos uploaded — not enough data to draw meaningful conclusions.</p>
    <p>Shutterstock was different: I had <strong>4,000 images</strong> on that platform.<br />
    Evergreen content such as <strong>MoT signs</strong>, <strong>roadwork images</strong>, and <strong>car showroom shots</strong> consistently generated downloads.</p>
    <p>Between <strong>January and March 2024</strong>, I uploaded hundreds of my Shutterstock photos to iStock to increase sales and gather more data.</p>
    <h3>Early Trends I Spotted on My iStock Account:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Car showroom pictures</li>
      <li>Photos of the high street</li>
      <li>Images of closed shops in town</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>What connects them?</strong><br />
    These subjects are highly relevant to publications and individuals creating content.<br />
    A row of cars can serve as a hero image for a dealership's website, while a "Shop Sale" photo can be licensed for articles about the UK high street.</p>
    <h2>🏆 Top 25 Photos | 2023–2025</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>2023:</strong> Most sales came from <strong>car images</strong>, followed by high street and tractor photos.</li>
      <li><strong>2024:</strong> Marked by dominance in <strong>car auction/dealership images</strong> and high street photos, with landmark images rising.</li>
      <li><strong>2025:</strong> Continued success in <strong>cars</strong> and <strong>UK high street</strong> themes.</li>
    </ul>
