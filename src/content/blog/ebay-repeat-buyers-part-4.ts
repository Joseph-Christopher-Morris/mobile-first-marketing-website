    <p>This part focuses on what happens when buyers return, ask about duplicates, or order multiple cars in one go. These <strong>eBay repeat buyers</strong> are a sign of strong trust and consistent customer satisfaction.</p>

    <h2>Prologue: Selling in Batches</h2>

    <p>Some listings naturally led to repeat buyers. During the holiday season, <strong>multiple orders</strong> became common as people looked for gifts or wanted to grow their collections.<br />
    Customer feedback reinforced that I was doing something right. <strong>Fair descriptions</strong>, <strong>fast shipping</strong>, and <strong>transparent communication</strong> built loyalty.</p>

    <h2>Handling Multi-Item Requests</h2>

    <p>When buyers placed bids on several cars, I created a <strong>custom invoice</strong> with updated postage. I used <strong>sturdy boxes</strong> with padding to ensure models stayed safe.</p>

    <p><strong>Examples of well‑paired models:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>White <strong>Minichamps Escort RS Cosworth</strong></li>
      <li>Yellow <strong>Minichamps MK1 Mondeo</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Managing Duplicate Listings</h2>

    <p>Some buyers asked about models I had already sold. When I had a duplicate, I <strong>reviewed its condition</strong> and <strong>relisted</strong> accordingly.</p>

    <p><strong>Popular repeat sellers included:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>MK2 Focus RS</strong></li>
      <li><strong>MK3 Focus ST</strong> <em>(Minichamps)</em></li>
      <li><strong>Norev Focus RS MK3</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Admin and Logistics</h2>

    <p><strong>Multi-item orders added steps:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Adjusting invoices</li>
      <li>Re‑weighing packages</li>
      <li>Printing labels</li>
      <li>Tracking communication</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These orders were more complex but often more rewarding.</p>
