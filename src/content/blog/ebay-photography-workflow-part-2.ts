    <p>This article explores my photo setup, editing workflow, and the first signs of customer issues. Learning how to adapt early helped me improve quality and avoid future mistakes.</p>

    <h2>Prologue: Lessons from Early Sales</h2>

    <p>In the first week, <strong>90%</strong> of the cars arrived safely. But two models raised concerns:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>Ford Mondeo BTCC</strong> looked more damaged than expected.</li>
      <li>An <strong>Ultimate Green Ford Focus RS</strong> had paint blemishes and misaligned wheels.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A mix of positive and constructive feedback</h3>

    <p>Buyers shared photos of the issues. I issued <strong>full refunds</strong> and arranged returns.<br />
    One buyer, who paired the green Focus RS with a black <strong>RS500</strong>, gave balanced feedback. They appreciated the refund and the honesty of my page.</p>

    <h2>Building an eBay Photography Workflow That Scales</h2>

    <p>To maintain listing quality, I built a reliable eBay photography workflow that allowed me to scale production without losing consistency:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Set up a <strong>mini studio</strong> with consistent lighting and angles.</li>
      <li>Use a <strong>Sony A7III</strong> with a <strong>Nikon F-mount lens</strong> for sharp macro shots.</li>
      <li><strong>Edit in Lightroom</strong>, enhancing clarity while preserving accuracy.</li>
      <li><strong>List strategically</strong>, starting with high-interest models to draw traffic.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I often listened to music or podcasts during the process to stay focused, especially when aiming to take advantage of eBay's <strong>promotional listing weekends</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Managing Efficiency with AI</h2>

    <img src="/images/blog/Screenshot 2025-08-14 094346.webp" alt="AI-generated listing description showing workflow efficiency improvements" />

    <p>To speed up descriptions, I used <strong>AI-generated drafts</strong> as starting points. I always reviewed them carefully to correct inaccuracies, add the <strong>"can combine postage"</strong> note, and maintain a personal tone.</p>

    <p>This helped me stay productive without compromising quality.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p><em>The result of a refined workflow — consistent, professional product photography that builds buyer trust.</em></p>

    <p>This phase taught me the importance of sharp photography, detailed editing, and handling customer dissatisfaction with <strong>professionalism</strong>.</p>
