    <h2>Scaling My Stock Photography Portfolio: How I Built a Semi-Passive Income Stream</h2>

    <p>A skyscraper would be a great analogy for my stock photography journey. You have to build the foundations and get your materials to the building site to watch the project unfold over the years.</p>

    <p>I didn't expect stock photography to be easy money. I wanted one thing: <strong>a recurring income stream from my creative work</strong>.</p>

    <p>In Part 1, I explained why I eliminated middlemen like Wirestock. I began licensing directly with Shutterstock, Adobe Stock, and iStock.</p>

    <p>In Part 2, I broke down how consistency grew my earnings from <strong>$2.36 in 2022</strong> to <strong>$146.54 in 2023</strong>.</p>

    <p>Now, in Part 3, I'll show you how I scaled my stock photography earnings to over <strong>$1,100</strong> in less than three years. I turned it into a steady side income.</p>

    <h2>📊 My Stock Photography Revenue (2022–2025)</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>2022:</strong> $2.36</li>
      <li><strong>2023:</strong> $146.54</li>
      <li><strong>2024:</strong> $552.84</li>
      <li><strong>2025 (to date):</strong> $465.33</li>
    </ul>

    <p>That's <strong>$1,166.07 in total</strong>, with 2025 shaping up to be my best year yet.</p>

    <h2>📸 Top-Selling Photos (And Why I Think They Worked)</h2>

    <p><em>Real performance data showing which types of images generated the most revenue across platforms.</em></p>

    <h3>For Sale Sign in Residential Area</h3>
    <p>Practical for property listings, blogs, and local news stories.<br />
    <strong>Adobe Stock | 16 downloads | Royalty $11.22.</strong></p>

    <h3>London Stock Exchange Group Crest</h3>
    <p>Corporate, financial, and business articles love this kind of image.<br />
    <strong>Shutterstock | 32 Downloads | Royalty $9.46.</strong></p>

    <h3>Row of Audi Cars at Dealership</h3>
    <p>Car culture and dealership-related content made this a recurring seller.<br />
    <strong>iStock | 252 Downloads | Royalty $113.60.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Why they sold:</strong><br />
    These images weren't viral hits; they filled ongoing, evergreen content needs.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Real estate shots, such as those featuring for-sale signs, work year-round for property listings, blogs, and housing market reports.</li>
      <li>Corporate signage like the London Stock Exchange image fits financial news, business articles, and investment content.</li>
      <li>Car dealership rows serve automotive blogs, dealership ads, and car industry features.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Simple subjects, clean composition, and strong keywords paired with topics that always need fresh visuals. That's why they sold steadily.</p>

    <h2>📈 My Portfolio Size by Platform (as of July 17th 2025)</h2>

    <p><strong>My major stock photography portfolios:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Shutterstock:</strong> 7,100 assets</li>
      <li><strong>Adobe Stock:</strong> 132 assets</li>
      <li><strong>iStock:</strong> 2,837 assets</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Uploads slowed in early 2025 as I shifted focus to freelance work. However, even older uploads continued to generate downloads.</p>

    <h2>🧩 Key Takeaways</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Patience pays off:</strong> My revenue didn't explode overnight. It built steadily with uploads and smart keywording.</li>
      <li><strong>Boring sells:</strong> Simple, high-utility images often outperformed "creative" shots.</li>
      <li><strong>Platforms reward volume:</strong> Shutterstock drove the most downloads; Adobe Stock generated the best royalties.</li>
      <li><strong>Consistency compounds:</strong> My income grew because I treated stock like a marathon, not a sprint.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Importance of Quality and Consistency</h2>

    <p>When building a stock photography portfolio, quality is crucial. Each image should be sharp, well-composed, and relevant. Consistency in style and subject matter helps establish a brand. This brand recognition can lead to repeat customers and increased sales.</p>

    <h2>Strategies for Success</h2>

    <p>To succeed in stock photography, consider these strategies:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Research Trends:</strong> Stay updated on market trends. Identify what types of images are in demand and create content accordingly.</li>
      <li><strong>optimise Keywords:</strong> Use relevant keywords to improve searchability. Think like a buyer when selecting keywords.</li>
      <li><strong>Engage with the Community:</strong> Join stock photography forums and social media groups. Networking can provide insights and support.</li>
      <li><strong>Diversify Your Portfolio:</strong> Offer a range of subjects. This increases your chances of sales across different markets.</li>
      <li><strong>Regularly Update Your Portfolio:</strong> Keep your portfolio fresh by adding new images regularly. This signals to platforms that you are an active contributor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
