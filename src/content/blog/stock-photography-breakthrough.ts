    <p>I didn't jump into stock photography expecting overnight success.<br />
    I got in for one reason: to build a recurring income stream from my creative work.</p>

    <p>In <strong>Part 1</strong>, I shared how I cut out middlemen like Wirestock and started licensing directly with Shutterstock and Adobe Stock.</p>

    <p>Now, I'll break down how steady uploads turned into <strong>$148.90</strong> in under 18 months and the key lessons that made it happen. Keep reading to discover my stock photography breakthrough.</p>

    <h2>📈 The Growth That Took Time — And Paid Off</h2>

    <p>By January 2023, I had nearly <strong>1,000 assets</strong> on Shutterstock. It wasn't an explosive start, but it was consistent.</p>

    <img src="/images/blog/Shutterstock_Downloads_Earnings_Jan_Apr_2023.webp" alt="Shutterstock earnings and revenue line chart (January to April 2023)" />

    <ul>
      <li>🔹 <strong>January 2023:</strong> 5 downloads — $1.93</li>
      <li>🔹 <strong>February 2023:</strong> 7 downloads — $2.08</li>
      <li>🔹 <strong>March 2023:</strong> 10 downloads — $7.11</li>
      <li>🔹 <strong>April 2023:</strong> 13 downloads — $5.36</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My Shutterstock revenue started to compound. Small amounts, but noticeable.<br />
    My breakthrough wasn't viral — it was <strong>volume</strong>.</p>

    <h2>🚀 Diversifying to Adobe Stock & iStock</h2>

    <p>In 2023, <strong>Adobe Stock</strong> and <strong>iStock</strong> combined accounted for approximately <strong>22%</strong> of my total stock photography income. Not massive individually, but they played a key role in building a broader, more resilient revenue stream.</p>

    <p><strong>Why it mattered:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Adobe Stock had better royalty rates.</li>
      <li>iStock opened doors to a different buyer market.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🎯 The Real Lessons I Learned</h2>

    <h3>1. Uploading in Batches Builds Momentum</h3>
    <p>Every batch of 20–50 uploads sparked a spike in downloads.</p>

    <h3>2. Agency Royalty Rates Are Wildly Different</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Adobe Stock and Alamy paid better per download.</li>
      <li>Shutterstock and iStock delivered volume.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Patience Is a Superpower</h3>

    <p>Growth wasn't linear.<br />
    Some months were slow. Others picked up when I uploaded niche or seasonal content.</p>

    <p>That mindset of patience, testing, and playing the long game helped me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>✔️ Grow my freelance work</li>
      <li>✔️ Win bigger clients</li>
      <li>✔️ Build a brand with work featured on:
        <ul>
          <li>• BBC News</li>
          <li>• Financial Times</li>
          <li>• Forbes</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💵 My 2023 Earnings Breakdown (Stock Photography Breakthrough)</h2>

    <img src="/images/blog/Stock_Photography_Earnings_Comparison.webp" alt="Stock photography bar chart showing revenue from Shutterstock, Adobe Stock, and iStock" />

    <ul>
      <li><strong>January 2023 – December 2023:</strong> $146.54 (across Shutterstock, Adobe Stock, and iStock)</li>
      <li><strong>Total:</strong> $148.90 from stock photography in under 18 months.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Three platforms. Proof that even small sales can snowball with patience and consistency.</p>

    <h2>🧩 What This Means For Creatives Like You</h2>

    <p>Stock photography isn't a get-rich-quick scheme. It's a long game.</p>

    <p>If you can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Upload consistently.</li>
      <li>Accept low initial payouts.</li>
      <li>Treat it like a slow-burn investment.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Then it becomes a real, semi-passive income stream over time.</p>

    <p>For me, stock photography wasn't just a side hustle — it became a creative testing ground.<br />
    Sharpening my strategy, building resilience, and proving how consistent effort turns into long-term value.</p>

    <p>That mindset helped me land larger clients, grow my freelance work, and establish a brand with published work featured in <strong>BBC</strong>, <strong>Financial Times</strong>, and <strong>Forbes</strong>.</p>
