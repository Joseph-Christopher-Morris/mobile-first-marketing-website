    <p>What started as a personal project to downsize my own Hot Wheels collection turned into something much bigger: photographing and selling my neighbour's prized Ford model car collection on eBay.</p>

    <p>This article is the first part of a five-part series where I'll walk through how I photographed, listed, packaged, and shipped dozens of model cars — while refining my digital skills and navigating real customer expectations.</p>

    <h2>Prologue: Starting Small, Thinking Big</h2>

    <p>In 2022 and 2023, I began slimming down my Hot Wheels car collection to earn a little extra income. At the same time, I wanted to learn the basics of e-commerce and customer service.</p>

    <p>Through photographing each vehicle, editing images, and writing accurate and engaging descriptions, I aimed to create a great experience for every buyer. These early sales helped build a reputation for reliability.</p>

    <p>Alongside this, I was freelancing as a photographer for classic car auctions. With strong market demand, I was able to sharpen my skills in both photography and vehicle presentation.</p>

    <h2>A Seasonal Shift</h2>

    <p>As autumn arrived, auction shoots slowed down. The darker evenings and colder days pushed me back toward eBay, where I focused on selling as many Hot Wheels as possible before Christmas. Positive customer feedback helped me improve my workflow and listings, and I began to double down on strategies that worked.</p>

    <h2>The Ford Opportunity</h2>

    <p>In June 2024, my neighbour approached me. A long-time Ford UK employee with a background in testing and stunt driving, he had a personal collection of Ford die-cast models. He offered me a commission to photograph and sell them on eBay.</p>

    <p>We agreed on a <strong>flat 25% commission</strong> on the final sale price, excluding postage costs. This ensured fairness while covering the time I spent on photography, listings, packaging, and customer service.</p>

    <p>This was a step up in terms of item value, condition expectations, and the need for a professional, scalable system.</p>

    <h2>Photographing the First Model</h2>

    <p><em>The first model I photographed — a 1:18 AUTOART Ford Focus WRC Rally car in my portable studio setup.</em></p>

    <p>The first car I shot was a <strong>1:18 AUTOART Ford Focus WRC Rally car</strong>. It barely fit in my portable studio, but it drew attention despite some cosmetic wear.</p>

    <p>Using a <strong>Sony A7III</strong> with a <strong>Nikon F-mount lens and converter</strong>, I adapted my setup to get sharp close-up shots. Macro photography proved essential in capturing detail, especially for collector-grade models.</p>

    <h2>Analytics and Optimisation</h2>

    <p><em>Part of the collection showing the variety and quality of models I was working with.</em></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>137,917 impressions in one week — 100% organic.<br />
      No ads. Just timing, SEO, and product knowledge.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>These weren't random models. Each represented my neighbour's personal automotive journey. That gave me extra motivation to present the collection with care. I repurposed packaging materials and cardboard to safely ship each model while minimising waste.</p>

    <p>In just one week (June 14–21, 2024), the model Ford listings earned over <strong>137,000 impressions organically on eBay</strong>, with a <strong>1.1% CTR</strong>.<br />
    I tracked these metrics to refine timing and optimise titles for better visibility.</p>

    <h2>Why This Model Ford Car Collection on eBay Mattered</h2>

    <p><em>Real eBay performance data showing how organic traffic drove sales without paid promotions.</em></p>

    <p>I used <strong>eBay's Performance and Traffic pages</strong> to monitor impressions, click-through rates, and sales. This helped me adjust titles, timing, and groupings to improve results without using promoted listings.</p>
