    <p><em>Listing Strategy and Conversion Lessons</em></p>

    <p>In this third part of the series, I'll walk you through the tactics I used to improve the conversion rate when selling my neighbour's model Ford collection. From timing listings to writing efficient descriptions and encouraging multi-item purchases, this phase of the project brought out the eCommerce strategist in me.</p>

    <h2>Prologue: Why Combined Postage Matters</h2>

    <p>One of the best ways to encourage more sales on eBay is to offer <strong>combined postage</strong>. This strategy appeals to buyers who want to grow their collection or save money while shopping.</p>

    <p>Combined postage benefits both sides: the buyer saves on shipping, and the seller can increase the <strong>average order value</strong> while using fewer packaging materials.<br />
    It also creates an opportunity to upsell items that might not have sold as quickly on their own.</p>

    <p>For collectors, combined postage is especially valuable. Whether someone is reliving childhood memories or shopping for a birthday gift, they appreciate the chance to buy multiple items from the same seller without paying a separate shipping fee for each one.</p>

    <h2>Optimising eBay Model Car Sales with Smart Bundling</h2>

    <img src="/images/blog/240602-Car_Collection-7.webp" alt="Norev 1:43 Scale metallic brown Ford B-Max" />

    <p>Before I began listing each item, I grouped cars that complemented each other in case buyers were interested in purchasing more than one. This <strong>bundling technique</strong> became a core part of my eBay model car sales strategy.<br />
    For example, I paired a <strong>brown Ford B-Max</strong> with a <strong>gold Ford Edge</strong>. These visual or thematic pairings made browsing more appealing and encouraged buyers to explore my other listings.</p>

    <p>I also continued to list some of my <strong>Hot Wheels stock</strong> alongside the model Fords. This gave casual collectors an entry point to visit my page, which helped drive additional views.</p>

    <p>To maintain efficiency, I applied a consistent method to my photography and editing. Each model car was photographed using the same <strong>lighting and angles</strong> to create a uniform look across the listings. This consistency gave my eBay page a professional appearance and built trust with potential buyers.</p>

    <p>Once the photos were ready, I edited them to enhance clarity while staying true to the actual condition of the models. <strong>Accuracy</strong> remained my top priority.</p>

    <h2>Listing with Speed and Accuracy</h2>

    <p>Below is an example of one of the listings I created using my photo-editing workflow and written description:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Minichamps 1:43 Ford Escort Cosworth Mobil 1 Rally Monte Carlo 1993 #6</strong></p>
    </blockquote>

    <img src="/images/blog/240616-Model_Car_Collection-3.webp" alt="Minichamps 1:43 Scale red Ford Escort RS Cosworth model car in studio" />

    <p>I created product listings for each Ford and Jaguar model based on the images I had edited. Each listing included important fields such as <strong>brand</strong>, <strong>scale</strong>, <strong>condition</strong>, and <strong>model type</strong>.</p>

    <p>To expedite the process of listing multiple cars, I utilised an <strong>AI-generated description draft</strong> as a starting point. This helped reduce time spent writing from scratch. However, I always reviewed and edited each draft carefully.<br />
    I corrected any errors, added important notes such as <strong>"can combine postage"</strong>, and ensured each listing felt accurate and honest.</p>

    <p>This approach enabled me to increase my <strong>listing volume</strong> while maintaining a consistent and reliable buyer experience.</p>

    <h2>Publishing and Tracking Conversions</h2>

    <p>Once I had about <strong>100 listings</strong> ready, I waited for the right moment to publish them. I aimed to post them around <strong>5 PM British Summer Time</strong>, particularly during weekends when eBay offered reduced seller fees.</p>

    <p>Publishing during this window meant more eyes on my listings and more potential conversions. It also benefited John and me financially, as we paid less in platform fees.</p>

    <p>During the sale period, I closely tracked which cars had bids and which buyers were bidding on multiple items. This helped me prepare the right boxes for packaging, especially when orders included several models.</p>

    <h2>Single-Item Sales vs. Multi-Item Orders</h2>

    <img src="/images/blog/Screenshot 2025-08-14 094204.webp" alt="Example of a combined order" />

    <p>Single-item orders were easier to package. There was a reduced risk of models rubbing against each other and fewer concerns about display cases being damaged during shipping.</p>

    <p>Multi-item orders required more effort. Buyers often messaged me in advance asking, <em>"How much will postage be if I buy six 1:43 scale Fords?"</em> The answer was usually <strong>£3.19</strong> for a Royal Mail small parcel, based on 2024–2025 rates. However, heavier parcels would require a slightly higher fee.</p>

    <p>There was also additional administrative work involved in updating the total cost and postage on invoices. I had to <strong>weigh the items</strong>, <strong>recalculate shipping</strong>, and <strong>select suitable boxes</strong> with extra packing materials to protect the models in transit.</p>

    <p>While more time-consuming, multi-item orders were <strong>well worth the effort</strong>. They reflected buyer trust and helped reduce overall packaging costs.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>I relied on <strong>intuition</strong>, <strong>experience from selling Hot Wheels</strong>, and a <strong>transparent workflow</strong> to make the most of each listing. Timing was another key factor. Posting listings on <strong>Sunday afternoons</strong> proved far more effective than uploading them during quiet times, such as early mornings on weekdays.</p>

    <p><strong>Combined postage</strong>, <strong>thoughtful bundling</strong>, and <strong>high-quality photos</strong> all played a role in increasing conversion rates and helping more of John's collection find the right buyers.</p>

    <p>In the next part of the series, I'll talk about what happened when buyers returned for more, how I packaged multi-item orders, and what it was like to manage inventory at scale.</p>
