    <p>One flyer landed my first freelance win.</p>
    <p>The second? It lit the fuse.</p>
    <p>Race teams. Auction gigs. Referrals. Real income.</p>
    <p>All from a refined flyer marketing strategy that most people overlook.</p>
    <p>In a world inundated with social ads and AI-generated content, authentic marketing that connects remains effective. And I've got the results to prove it.</p>

    <h2>🧠 Strategy Behind Flyer Marketing V2</h2>
    <p>The front of my Version 2 flyer introduces people to my photography business, gives a summary of me as a photographer and shows the prices of my photography services.</p>
    <p>By April 2021, I'd covered the JSCC Scholarships and shot a Lamborghini SVJ Roadster. That gave me stronger material for a better flyer.</p>
    <p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cleaner design and premium feel</li>
      <li>Better image variety</li>
      <li>Add real testimonials</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Back of Version 2 Flyer – Built to build trust fast. Testimonials, standout client results, and over 2 million views helped me show proof, not just promise. It introduced my work, my audience, and what makes my images different.</p>
    <p><strong>Images:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cover: McLaren 650S</li>
      <li>Pricing: Lotus Evora GT410</li>
      <li>Featured: SVJ Roadster, JSCC</li>
      <li>Details: R8 V10, Dalmatian & Lamborghini</li>
      <li>About me: On-location portrait</li>
      <li>I chose each shot to stop thumbs and start conversations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📸 The First Big Win: Hampson Auctions</h2>

    <p>In August 2021, I handed my new flyer to Zach at Hampson Auctions at the Tatton Park Classic Car Show.</p>
    <p>Zach let me shoot their stand on the spot.</p>
    <p>By August 30th, 2021, I was covering their Oulton Park Gold Cup sale. I've worked with Hampson Auctions ever since.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Thanks, Joe. I hope you enjoyed the auction. And thanks for all your help. You're always welcome. You're part of the team.</p>
      <p>— Zach Hamilton, Managing Director, Hampson Auctions</p>

    <h2>🚗 Real Gigs, Real Encounters</h2>

    <p>At TRAX Silverstone, I brought flyers, a Nikon D850, and £10,000 of Edelkrone gear.</p>
    <p><strong>I walked away with the following:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Paid shoots: Vauxhall Astra VXR & Audi TTRS</li>
      <li>Filmed the UK's biggest Audi R8 meet</li>
      <li>I met an auctioneer who later referred me to Historics Auctioneers</li>
      <li>All from showing up and talking to people. That was just the start.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🏁 The Car & Classic Breakthrough</h2>

    />
    <p>By June 2022, my flyers had unlocked contracts with top auction houses and race teams; now it was time to scale. I landed a freelance gig with Car & Classic — over 60 paid photoshoots since.</p>
    <p>Duncan's referral opened the door to North West Motor Auction.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>That's a great picture. Thank you very much! I hope you had a great day and got some good shots. See you next time.</p>
      <p>— Duncan Brown, Auctioneer 4 Hire</p>
