  title: 'Flyer Marketing Case Study #2: Scaling Success and Learning from Setbacks',
  excerpt: 'How momentum built from the first flyer success, refined designs led to bigger clients, and what I learned when one client didn\'t pay.',
  content: `
    <p>After the success of my first flyer campaign, momentum was building. But scaling offline marketing isn't just about printing more—it's about <strong>refining your approach</strong> and learning from both wins and losses.</p>

    <p>By early 2023, I'd levelled up my content and my clients. I had repeated work with Car & Classic, stronger visuals, and better grammar. Time to scale.</p>

    <h2>🚀 Flyer V3: Built to Scale</h2>

    <p><strong>Flyer V3 Goals:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>More varied, premium images</li>
      <li>Tighter writing</li>
      <li>A show-stopping cover</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I chose each image to <strong>create emotion, not just fill space.</strong> The new design showcased:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Premium automotive photography</strong> from actual client work</li>
      <li><strong>Varied compositions</strong> showing technical range</li>
      <li><strong>Professional layout</strong> that felt like a high-end brochure</li>
      <li><strong>Clear contact information</strong> and service offerings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>⚠️ NEC Show Roadbump</h2>

    <img src="/images/blog/230112_NEC_Autoshow-132.webp" alt="The Praga R1R race car at the ROWE trade stand at the NEC Autosport International show" />

    <p>Right before the NEC Autosport International, Vistaprint emailed me:</p>
    <blockquote>"Can't print in time."</blockquote>

    <p>I called, got it sorted, and got refunded.<br />
    But by show day, only the old flyers were ready.</p>

    <p>The NEC didn't deliver many leads, but it was still worth attending. I met passionate people and saw the best of motorsport tech — <strong>still a win.</strong></p>

    <h2>📉 The Client Who Didn't Pay… At First</h2>

    <p>Not every lead is golden.</p>

    <p>Bidding Classics found me via LinkedIn. I delivered the work. Then came the silence.</p>

    <p>Like other photographers, I chased overdue invoices and eventually had to file a CCJ.<br />
    It worked — I got paid. But it reminded me that not every flashy brand respects your time.</p>

    <p>That experience sharpened my filters. Now I vet leads more thoroughly and focus on clients who <strong>value the craft.</strong></p>

    <h2>💰 Building Momentum: Year-by-Year Growth</h2>

    <p>The flyer strategy wasn't just about one-off wins. It built <strong>compound growth</strong>:</p>

    <p><strong>2021 — £780</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hampson Auctions (first major client)</li>
      <li>JSCC (motorsport breakthrough)</li>
      <li>Bathgate Silica Sand (unexpected bonus)</li>
      <li>Individual car shoots (Vauxhall VXR, Audi TTS)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>2022 — £3,590.59</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hampson Auctions (repeat business)</li>
      <li>Northwest Motor Auction (referral)</li>
      <li>Car & Classic (major breakthrough)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>2023 — £5,968.47</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hampson Auctions (ongoing relationship)</li>
      <li>Car & Classic (regular work)</li>
      <li>Historics Auctioneers (expansion)</li>
      <li>Bidding Classics (payment issues resolved)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧩 Key Lessons from Scaling</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Flyers made me visible in high-trust spaces.</strong> Car shows, auctions, and motorsport events where my ideal clients gathered.</li>
      <li><strong>My portfolio fed word-of-mouth.</strong> Each successful shoot led to referrals and repeat business.</li>
      <li><strong>Referrals snowballed into real money.</strong> One client introduction often led to multiple opportunities.</li>
      <li><strong>Quality over quantity.</strong> Better to have fewer, higher-paying clients than chase every lead.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment terms matter.</strong> Clear contracts and payment schedules prevent headaches later.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🎯 What's Next</h2>

    <p>While I shifted focus to <strong>digital marketing and website optimisation</strong>, the flyer foundation kept working in the background. The relationships built through offline marketing continued generating revenue years later.</p>

    <p>The total return? <strong>£13,563.92 from a £546 investment</strong> — a <strong>2,380% ROI</strong> that proved offline marketing still works in our digital world.</p>
