# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for migrating from AWS Amplify to a S3 + CloudFront deployment solution for the mobile-first marketing website. After 31 failed Amplify deployments due to Next.js SSR detection issues, we need a reliable static hosting solution that can handle Next.js static exports without framework detection problems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Static Site Hosting Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy my Next.js static export to AWS infrastructure, so that I can have reliable hosting without framework detection issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I deploy the static site THEN the system SHALL create an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting
2. WHEN the S3 bucket is created THEN the system SHALL configure it with proper public access policies
3. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL serve the index.html file as the default document
4. WHEN a 404 error occurs THEN the system SHALL serve index.html to support SPA routing
5. IF the deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback options

### Requirement 2: Content Delivery Network (CDN)

**User Story:** As an end user, I want fast global access to the website, so that I can have optimal performance regardless of my location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the site is deployed THEN the system SHALL create a CloudFront distribution
2. WHEN content is requested THEN CloudFront SHALL cache static assets with appropriate TTL values
3. WHEN HTML files are requested THEN CloudFront SHALL use shorter cache times for dynamic content
4. WHEN the origin is updated THEN the system SHALL provide cache invalidation capabilities
5. WHEN HTTPS is requested THEN CloudFront SHALL redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS

### Requirement 3: Automated Deployment Pipeline

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated deployments from GitHub, so that I can deploy changes without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to main branch THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger a deployment
2. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL upload files to S3 with proper cache headers
3. WHEN deployment succeeds THEN the system SHALL invalidate CloudFront cache for updated files
4. WHEN deployment fails THEN the system SHALL notify the developer and maintain the previous version
5. IF sensitive files exist THEN the system SHALL exclude them from deployment

### Requirement 4: Custom Domain and SSL

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the website accessible via a custom domain with HTTPS, so that users can access it securely with a professional URL.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a custom domain is configured THEN the system SHALL support CNAME/ALIAS DNS records
2. WHEN HTTPS is enabled THEN the system SHALL use AWS Certificate Manager for SSL certificates
3. WHEN certificates are requested THEN the system SHALL handle automatic renewal
4. WHEN HTTP requests are made THEN the system SHALL redirect to HTTPS
5. IF domain validation is required THEN the system SHALL provide clear DNS configuration instructions

### Requirement 5: Monitoring and Analytics

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor deployment status and website performance, so that I can ensure optimal operation and quickly identify issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployments occur THEN the system SHALL log all deployment activities
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture and report detailed error information
3. WHEN performance metrics are needed THEN the system SHALL integrate with CloudWatch
4. WHEN cache performance is analyzed THEN the system SHALL provide CloudFront analytics
5. IF issues are detected THEN the system SHALL send notifications to configured channels

### Requirement 6: Cost Optimization

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want cost-effective hosting, so that I can minimize infrastructure expenses while maintaining performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN static assets are served THEN the system SHALL use appropriate S3 storage classes
2. WHEN cache headers are set THEN the system SHALL optimize for reduced origin requests
3. WHEN CloudFront is configured THEN the system SHALL use cost-effective edge locations
4. WHEN old versions exist THEN the system SHALL implement lifecycle policies for cleanup
5. IF usage patterns change THEN the system SHALL provide cost monitoring and alerts

### Requirement 7: Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want secure deployment and hosting, so that the website and deployment process are protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AWS credentials are used THEN the system SHALL follow principle of least privilege
2. WHEN S3 buckets are created THEN the system SHALL keep buckets private and use CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC)
3. WHEN CloudFront is configured THEN the system SHALL use security headers and restrict direct S3 access
4. WHEN deployments occur THEN the system SHALL use secure authentication methods
5. WHEN public access is needed THEN the system SHALL route all traffic through CloudFront only
6. IF security vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL provide remediation guidance

### Requirement 8: Rollback and Recovery

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ability to rollback deployments, so that I can quickly recover from problematic releases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a deployment completes THEN the system SHALL maintain previous version backups
2. WHEN rollback is requested THEN the system SHALL restore the previous working version
3. WHEN rollback occurs THEN the system SHALL invalidate CloudFront cache appropriately
4. WHEN multiple versions exist THEN the system SHALL provide version management capabilities
5. IF data corruption occurs THEN the system SHALL provide disaster recovery procedures
