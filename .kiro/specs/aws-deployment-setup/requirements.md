# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for deploying the existing mobile-first
marketing website to AWS Amplify. The website is already fully implemented and
needs to be configured for production deployment with proper environment
variables, CI/CD pipeline, and AWS services integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: AWS Amplify Hosting Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy the website to AWS Amplify with
automatic CI/CD, so that the site is hosted reliably with automatic deployments
on code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the repository is connected to AWS Amplify THEN the system SHALL
   automatically detect the Next.js framework and configure build settings
2. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN the system SHALL trigger an
   automatic build and deployment
3. WHEN the build completes successfully THEN the system SHALL serve the static
   site through CloudFront CDN
4. WHEN custom domain is configured THEN the system SHALL provision SSL
   certificates automatically
5. WHEN environment variables are set THEN the system SHALL use them during the
   build process

### Requirement 2: Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to properly configure environment
variables for production, so that the website functions correctly with contact
forms, analytics, and other features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN production environment variables are set THEN the system SHALL validate
   all required variables before deployment
2. WHEN contact forms are submitted THEN the system SHALL use the configured
   CONTACT_EMAIL for notifications
3. WHEN analytics tracking is enabled THEN the system SHALL use the configured
   Google Analytics ID
4. WHEN social media links are configured THEN the system SHALL display them
   correctly on the website
5. WHEN SMTP settings are provided THEN the system SHALL enable email
   functionality

### Requirement 3: Build Process Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to be optimized for
production deployment, so that the website loads quickly and performs well.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL validate content structure
   and environment variables
2. WHEN static assets are generated THEN the system SHALL optimize images and
   compress files
3. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL generate a sitemap and
   optimize SEO metadata
4. WHEN deployment occurs THEN the system SHALL invalidate CDN cache for updated
   content
5. WHEN performance monitoring is enabled THEN the system SHALL track Core Web
   Vitals

### Requirement 4: Security and Performance Configuration

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want the deployed site to be secure and
performant, so that users have a safe and fast browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security headers are configured THEN the system SHALL implement CSP,
   HSTS, and other security measures
2. WHEN caching is configured THEN the system SHALL set appropriate cache
   headers for different content types
3. WHEN HTTPS is enabled THEN the system SHALL redirect all HTTP traffic to
   HTTPS
4. WHEN compression is enabled THEN the system SHALL serve compressed assets to
   reduce load times
5. WHEN monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL track performance metrics and
   errors
