  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [x] 2. Synchronize Node.js version requirements


- [x] 2.1 Update package.json engines field





  - Specify Node >=22.19.0 and npm >=10.8.0 in engines field
  - Ensure compatibility with lighthouse@13 and vite@7.1.7 requirements
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 2.2 Verify dependency compatibility with Node 22.19.0





  - Check all dependencies for Node.js 22.19.0 compatibility
  - Identify any packages that may have version conflicts
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3_

- [x] 2.3 Document local development environment setup





  - Create instructions for upgrading local Node.js to 22.19.0
  - Provide multiple installation options (nvm-windows, corepack, direct install)
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.4_

- [x] 2.4 Test consistency between local and CI environments





  - Verify builds work identically in both environments
  - Ensure lockfile remains consistent after clean installs
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Verify and fix lockfile consistency



- [x] 3.1 Run npm ci locally to verify lockfile integrity

  - Execute npm ci command to check for lockfile sync issues
  - Identify any package version mismatches between package.json and lockfile
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4_


- [x] 3.2 Fix lockfile inconsistencies

  - Update lockfile to match package.json dependency specifications
  - Resolve @types/node version mismatch and other dependency conflicts
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4_


- [x] 3.3 Verify clean npm ci after fixes

  - Run npm ci again to confirm lockfile integrity is restored
  - Ensure no modifications occur to package-lock.json after clean install
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 3.4 Test reproducible builds between local and CI environments



  - Verify builds work identically in both environments after lockfile fixes
  - Document any remaining environment-specific considerations
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 4. Configure Git workflow settings





  - Set up CRLF normalization with core.autocrlf configuration

  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 5. Create verification and testing procedures
























  - Implement test commit workflow to validate CI fixes
  - Create validation scripts to check Node version consistency
  - Document troubleshooting steps for common issues
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [x] 6. Write comprehensive test suite for CI validation






  - Create automated tests for workflow validation
  - Implement integration tests for Git workflow consistency
  - Add performance benchmarks for build processes
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_
