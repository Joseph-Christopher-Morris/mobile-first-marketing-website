# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses GitHub Actions CI workflow failures and ensures consistency between local development and CI environments. The current issue is that local builds work fine with Node v20.15.1, but GitHub Actions fails due to Node engine mismatches with lighthouse@13 and vite@7.1.7 requiring Node ≥22.19.0. Additionally, there are Git workflow inconsistencies and lockfile warnings that need to be resolved.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want GitHub Actions workflows to run successfully without Node engine mismatch errors, so that CI/CD pipeline works reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to main branch THEN GitHub Actions "Quality Check" workflow SHALL complete successfully
2. WHEN workflow runs THEN it SHALL use Node.js version 22.19.0 consistently
3. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN there SHALL be no Node engine compatibility warnings
4. WHEN build process runs THEN it SHALL complete without version-related errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent Node.js version requirements across local and CI environments, so that builds behave identically in both contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN package.json is examined THEN it SHALL specify engines field with Node ≥22.19.0
2. WHEN local development occurs THEN Node version SHALL match CI environment version
3. WHEN npm ci runs THEN lockfile SHALL be consistent without modifications
4. WHEN build commands execute THEN they SHALL work identically locally and in CI

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean Git workflows without spurious warnings or file conflicts, so that commits and pushes work smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN git commands are executed THEN there SHALL be no "nothing added to commit" warnings
2. WHEN files are staged THEN deletions and updates SHALL be handled safely
3. WHEN CRLF normalization is configured THEN line ending conflicts SHALL be prevented
4. WHEN pushes occur THEN they SHALL not generate unexpected new files

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want generated and temporary files to be properly ignored, so that they don't appear in Git status or get accidentally committed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN build processes run THEN generated files SHALL be ignored by Git
2. WHEN compliance reports are created THEN they SHALL not be tracked in version control
3. WHEN .gitignore is configured THEN it SHALL prevent tracking of build artifacts
4. WHEN git status is checked THEN only intentional changes SHALL be shown

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI workflow to validate code quality consistently, so that code standards are maintained across all contributions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CI runs THEN it SHALL perform type checking if available
2. WHEN CI runs THEN it SHALL perform linting if available
3. WHEN CI runs THEN it SHALL verify lockfile consistency
4. WHEN CI runs THEN it SHALL build the project successfully
5. WHEN CI completes THEN all quality checks SHALL pass with green status

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simple verification steps to confirm CI fixes are working, so that I can validate the solution quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test commit is made THEN GitHub Actions SHALL show green status
2. WHEN workflow logs are examined THEN there SHALL be no Node version warnings
3. WHEN workflow completes THEN all steps SHALL pass successfully
4. WHEN local and CI builds are compared THEN they SHALL produce identical results
