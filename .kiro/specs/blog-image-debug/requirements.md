# Blog Image Debug Requirements

## Introduction

The "What I Learned From My Paid Ads Campaign" blog post consistently shows a blank/failed image on the homepage blog preview cards, despite multiple attempts to fix the image path and deployment. This spec will systematically identify and resolve the root cause.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Image Display Functionality

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see the Google Analytics screenshot on the first blog preview card, so that I can visually understand what the blog post is about.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the homepage loads THEN the first blog card SHALL display the Google Analytics screenshot image
2. WHEN the image loads THEN it SHALL be visible without any "Image failed to load" messages
3. WHEN accessed from different browsers THEN the image SHALL load consistently
4. WHEN viewed on mobile devices THEN the image SHALL display properly and be responsive

### Requirement 2: Systematic Debugging Process

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to systematically debug the image loading issue, so that I can identify and fix the root cause permanently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing direct image URL access THEN the system SHALL verify image accessibility
2. WHEN examining browser developer tools THEN the system SHALL identify specific error messages
3. WHEN checking component rendering logic THEN the system SHALL validate proper image path handling
4. WHEN testing deployment pipeline THEN the system SHALL confirm image inclusion in build output

### Requirement 3: Reliable Solution Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reliable, permanent solution, so that image loading works consistently without future issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the solution is implemented THEN it SHALL work across all deployment environments
2. WHEN cache invalidation occurs THEN images SHALL load reliably after updates
3. WHEN image loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallback mechanisms
4. WHEN future deployments occur THEN the image loading SHALL remain stable
