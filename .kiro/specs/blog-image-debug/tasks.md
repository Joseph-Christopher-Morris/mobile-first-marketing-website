# Blog Image Debug Implementation Tasks

## Root Cause Analysis Complete âœ…

**Issue Identified**: The BlogPreview component uses a regular `<img>` tag
instead of the `OptimizedImage` component, and the blog post references the
correct image path `/images/hero/paid-ads-analytics-screenshot.webp` which
exists in the file system.

## Implementation Tasks

- [x] 1. Fix BlogPreview Component Image Rendering

- [x] 1.1 Update BlogPreview Component Structure
  - Add 'use client' directive for React hooks compatibility
  - Import useState hook properly
  - Fix container positioning for OptimizedImage with fill prop
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.3_

- [x] 1.2 Enhance Image Loading and Error Handling
  - Implement retry mechanism for failed image loads (up to 2 retries)
  - Add comprehensive error logging for debugging
  - Improve loading state indicators with better UX
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.3_

- [x] 1.3 Optimize Image Display Properties
  - Change from object-contain to object-cover for better image display
  - Add proper z-index layering for loading states and badges
  - Implement key prop for forcing re-render on retry attempts
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4_

- [x] 1.4 Test Image Rendering with Existing Path
  - Verify image loads with path
    `/images/hero/paid-ads-analytics-screenshot.webp`
  - Test fallback mechanisms work correctly
  - Validate loading states and error handling
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 2. Build Process Verification and Fix
  - Resolve the Next.js build error preventing static export
  - Verify images are included in the build output directory
  - Test that the build process correctly copies public assets
  - Document build output structure for images
  - _Requirements: 2.4_

- [x] 3. Component Error Handling Enhancement
  - Add comprehensive error handling to OptimizedImage component
  - Implement fallback image mechanism for failed loads
  - Add loading state indicators and error messages
  - Test error handling with intentionally broken image paths
  - _Requirements: 3.3_

- [-] 4. Deployment Pipeline Image Verification

- [x] 4.1 Fix Build Process Image Inclusion
  - Resolve Next.js build directory cleanup issues
  - Ensure images are properly copied from public/ to out/ directory
  - Verify all source images are included in build output
  - _Requirements: 3.2_

- [x] 4.2 Fix Deployment Script Image Upload Issues
  - Verify deployment script handles all image file types correctly
  - Ensure proper MIME type configuration for WebP and other formats
  - Test that deployment script uploads images to correct S3 paths
  - _Requirements: 3.2_

- [x] 4.3 Verify S3 and CloudFront MIME Type Configuration
  - Check S3 objects have correct Content-Type headers for WebP files
  - Verify CloudFront serves images with proper MIME types
  - Test that browsers receive correct content-type headers
  - _Requirements: 3.4_

- [x] 4.4 Implement Post-Deployment Image Accessibility Validation
  - Create automated tests for image accessibility via CloudFront
  - Verify images load correctly from CDN endpoints
  - Test specific blog image that was failing
  - Generate comprehensive validation report
  - _Requirements: 3.4_

- [x] 5. Cross-Browser and Performance Testing
  - Test image loading across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
  - Verify WebP format support and fallback mechanisms
  - Test responsive image sizing and performance
  - Validate image loading on mobile devices
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4_

## Implementation Priority

**Start with Task 1** - Fix the BlogPreview component to use OptimizedImage
properly **Then Task 2** - Resolve build issues to enable proper testing
**Follow with Task 3** - Add comprehensive error handling **Then Task 4** -
Verify deployment pipeline works correctly **Finally Task 5** - Complete
cross-browser and performance testing

## Success Criteria

- Image loads successfully on homepage blog preview using OptimizedImage
  component
- Build process completes without errors and includes all image assets
- Comprehensive error handling provides fallback mechanisms
- Deployment pipeline correctly uploads and serves images
- Consistent behavior across all major browsers and devices

## Technical Notes

- **Image Path**: `/images/hero/paid-ads-analytics-screenshot.webp` (confirmed
  exists)
- **Component Issue**: BlogPreview uses `<img>` instead of `OptimizedImage`
- **Build Issue**: Next.js build failing on services pages (needs resolution)
- **Deployment**: S3 + CloudFront architecture with proper image handling
