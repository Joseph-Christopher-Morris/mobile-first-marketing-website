This is why we are providing you with the information in this Privacy Notice.</li><li><strong>The right of access</strong><br/>You have the right to obtain access to your information. This is so you are aware and can check that we are using your information in accordance with data protection law.</li><li><strong>The right to rectification</strong><br/>You are entitled to have your information corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete.</li><li><strong>The right to erasure</strong><br/>Also known as the right to be forgotten and, in simple terms, enables you to request the deletion or removal of your information where there is no compelling reason for us to keep using it. This is not a general right; there are exceptions.</li><li><strong>The right to restrict processing</strong><br/>You have rights to block or suppress further use of your information. When processing is restricted, we can still store your information, but may not use it further. We keep lists of people who have asked for further use of their information to be blocked to make sure the restriction is respected in future.</li><li><strong>The right to data portability</strong><br/>You have rights to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes across different services. This is not a normal scenario for companies of our nature but if you have any questions you can contact us.</li><li><strong>The right to object to processing</strong><br/>You have the right to object to certain types of automated processing or decision making, including processing for direct marketing or where we are relying on our legitimate interests for processing.</li><li><strong>The right to withdraw consent</strong><br/>If you have given your consent to anything we do with your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time (although if you do so, it does not mean that anything we have done with your personal data with your consent up to that point is unlawful).

We will verify your identity, noting how and when we verified it, then we will immediately delete any that data that we do not need.</p><p>We may send you a form which clarifies what information you need unless it is clear. If you can advise of the specific information that you require, we can process your request more quickly.</p><p>We will provide your personal data within one month of receiving identity verification, subject to any exemptions that we need to adhere to.</p><p>We will also explain why we have your personal data, who it could be disclosed to, the categories of data it involves and it will be in a format that you can access easily. You have the right to clarify and correct the information as necessary. It can be deleted providing that it is not required for legal or public interest reasons. If your request is more complex, for example it involves other data subjects and obtaining consent, we can extend our response time to three months, but we will inform you of this. We may need to anonymise this data or remove relevant details before sending this to you.</p><p>We will not charge for data subject access requests unless they are excessive or manifestly unfounded. Then we will charge for administrative time only.</p><p>If you are not satisfied with our response, please get in touch and we will do our best to help you: joe@vividauto.photography</p><h2>Cookies</h2><p>Our website does use cookies but all data is anonymised and you cannot be identified.
